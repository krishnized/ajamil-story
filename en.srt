1
00:00:58,0000 --> 00:01:04,589
There seem to be too many
poor people around lately!

2
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,240
What do you mean?

3
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,960
Whoever you stop, find nothing
worthwhile. Just pennies.

4
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,946
Listen, Ajamila...

5
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,661
You weren't always... like this...

6
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,393
Like what?

7
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:22,110
Well... involved in
what you are doing now.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,195
Why do you ask?

9
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,619
Just curious.

10
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:36,275
Yes, there was
a different Ajamila once...

11
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,330
A different life...
everything was different.

12
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,698
What did you do?

13
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:52,160
I was a Brahmin...
A priest.

14
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:57,141
...and then he rushes to Prahlada,

15
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:00,331
shakes him by the shoulders and screams:

16
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:03,290
"Where, where is your Vishnu? Show Him!"

17
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,770
And Prahlada?

18
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,000
Prahlada looks into his eyes
and replies with a smile:

19
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:15,570
"Dear father, look closely,
and you'll see the Lord everywhere."

20
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,570
And then?

21
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,160
And then Hiranyakashipu screams:

22
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,500
"So, your Vishnu is in my house?"

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,342
Prahlada replies with a smile:

24
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:29,401
"Yes, father, the Lord
is always in our home."

25
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,080
Then Hiranyakashipu grabs his sword

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,690
and starts swinging it, shouting:

27
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,430
"Vishnu! Vishnu! If You're here, come out!"

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,100
And when Hiranyakashipu saw no one,

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,400
he rushed at Prahlada
with his sword, saying:

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,630
"If your Vishnu doesn't appear before me now,

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,260
I'll cut off your head!"

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,135
And Prahlada?

33
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:55,872
Prahlada, this little boy,
tells his father:

34
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,177
"Here He is, my Lord,
right before you."

35
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:03,080
Hiranyakashipu points to a pillar and yells:

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,778
"Is he in this pillar?"

37
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:07,500
"Yes, father, can't you see?"

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,830
Then Hiranyakashipu grabs
his sword and with all his might

39
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,270
strikes the pillar...

40
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,526
But you know, Ajamila,

41
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:20,462
no one heard the sound of the broken pillar

42
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,560
Why?

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,230
Because at that moment,
there was a deafening roar of a lion,

44
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,100
...and the magnificent Lord Vishnu appeared.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,200
They fought for a long time
before Lord Narasimhadev

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,310
grabbed Hiranyakashipu,
laid him on his knees

47
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,970
and with his sharp claws
tore him to pieces.

48
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,874
And so saved his dear devotee Prahlada.

49
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,236
And would the Lord do the same for me?

50
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,957
Come to me and save me from demons?

51
00:03:55,957 --> 00:04:01,015
Of course, Ajamila.
The Lord's love never ceases.

52
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:05,160
Even if we forget about Him,

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,860
He continues to love us.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,068
And is always ready to come to our aid.

55
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,567
This... this... this is so wonderful.

56
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:26,306
Yes, my son. This is the ultimate truth.

57
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,801
Father, are you okay?

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:35,214
Yes, my boy, I'm fine, just a bad omen.

59
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,304
Father

60
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:46,583
What, my boy?

61
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,720
Father, tell Swamiji about
what I asked you today.

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
Ah, yes,

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,840
During our pilgrimage,
Ajamila made an important decision

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,001
He wants to receive initiation from you.

65
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh Gurudev, please accept me
as a disciple.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,029
I ask you for this mercy.

67
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,889
I will not leave this path.

68
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,360
Never?

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,830
Never!

70
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, Lochan Babu, gather your son.

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,182
Tomorrow I want to see him in my ashram.

72
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:30,000
Gurudev, so you've accepted me?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,442
Of course, my boy.

74
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,110
Father, did you hear?

75
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,287
Yes, my boy, yes, wonderful!

76
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,699
Ajamila…

77
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:44,820
Yes, Gurudev.

78
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,591
Today marks a wonderful day, long awaited.

79
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,940
Are you ready to be devoted to the truth

80
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,919
in all circumstances of your life,

81
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,000
and be faithful to the Brahmanical vows?

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,960
I am ready, Gurudev.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,690
Do you promise to follow the spiritual path

84
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,568
until the end of your days?

85
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,720
I promise, Gurudev

86
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,156
Name me the Brahmanical qualities
you will exhibit.

87
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:11,866
Honesty, purity, ability
to perform austerities,

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,987
calmness, freedom from anger, forgiveness,

89
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:18,250
non-violence towards any living being.

90
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,465
Ajamila.

91
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,623
Yes, father.

92
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:30,000
Have you forgotten
what you have to do today?

93
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,720
What are you talking about?

94
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,825
Ah, tomorrow we will perform...

95
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,685
Tomorrow at dawn

96
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,539
we will perform an auspicious ceremony.

97
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,053
Of course, I remember.
I haven't forgotten at all.

98
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:51,630
So, you should go to the forest right now

99
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,699
for suitable firewood.

100
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,450
Clean, dry, an elbow's length…

101
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,306
…pleasant to the eye.

102
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,680
Right.

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Also, you should bring forest flowers.

104
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,599
Clean, pleasant to the eye,
and with a good fragrance.

105
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,381
Right. But don't smell them!

106
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:18,076
Go right now, you'll be back by lunchtime.

107
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:22,902
And after lunch, we have
some chores to do.

108
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:43,950
What? Right here? Now? Are you sure?

109
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,518
Please! My Goddess! Do you want me dead?

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,635
Goddess, am I a goddess? Is this gold?

111
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,540
Gold! All gold! Yes, Goddess!

112
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:06,410
Take it! All the gold in the world! All yours!

113
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,456
Please be kind to me!

114
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:10,832
Yes? Goddess!

115
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:14,868
Yes, my fool!

116
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,048
Father, I can't take it anymore. Where is he?

117
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,108
...I don't know.

118
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,872
Father, what should we do?

119
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,640
A whole day has passed,
and he's still not back.

120
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,741
First, calm down. Sit, eat.

121
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,519
You haven't eaten anything
since morning.

122
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,800
A whole day has passed.

123
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:58,270
The sun is about to set,
and he's still not back.

124
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:06,600
What if something happened to him?
What if he was attacked by robbers?

125
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,720
There are always many robbers in the forest!
Or what if he was bitten by a snake?

126
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
No!

127
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,080
It was a scorpion.

128
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,390
There are always many poisonous
scorpions in the forest.

129
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:20,750
And now my Ajamila

130
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,962
lies in the grass, dying from its venom.

131
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,799
I will go look for him!

132
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,328
Well, say something to me.

133
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:33,448
What?

134
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,168
Well, make something up.

135
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,602
You are so vocal, after all.

136
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:42,010
Sorry, dear, I have to go.

137
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,651
Won't you say a word?

138
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,744
Why should I?

139
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,030
I want to hear about
your passion one more time.

140
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
You'll hear it.

141
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,250
Later.

142
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,389
But I want it now.

143
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,010
Later. I'm in a hurry.

144
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,115
Well, tell me I'm a goddess.

145
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,589
Well, goddess.

146
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,010
Not like that! Say it as you did before!

147
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,205
Like this: "My Goddess"!

148
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,835
I didn't say that.

149
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,441
What?

150
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:22,321
Like this "My Goddess" - I never said that.

151
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:25,146
I didn't say it like that!

152
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:28,480
Didn't say it? Ah, you rascal!

153
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,459
Get away from me.

154
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,459
Calm down! Everything's fine.

155
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,736
Nothing happened.

156
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,539
Not fine! You're cold-hearted!

157
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,270
A stone, that's who you are!

158
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,392
Can't even be nice to me.

159
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,130
Yes, I can be nice... But later.

160
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,177
Then we'll talk later.

161
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:55,740
So, in a week?.. My goddess?

162
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,600
Go away.

163
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,447
Bye then.

164
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,970
No daughter, you're not going
to the forest alone. Sit down!

165
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,730
How can I just sit and do nothing?

166
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,171
I cannot live without him.

167
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:18,086
I will pray. I hope he returns soon.

168
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,980
Ah, daughter, daughter.

169
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:30,747
My heart hurts like never before.

170
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:35,250
Something terrible has happened to him.
Father, I feel something terrible.

171
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,889
You... so beautiful... like a flower...

172
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:46,821
Flower! And everyone tells me I'm a goddess!

173
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,120
Are you talking about that man?..
Who is he to you?

174
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,310
Man? So, you saw him, Ajamila?

175
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,837
I did.

176
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:06,315
And now what?

177
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,066
I don't know.

178
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:16,626
But I know. Shall I tell?

179
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,983
Lean in to me. I'll whisper it in your ear.

180
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,570
You probably also want to be with me here,

181
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,326
in the forest, where no one sees us?..

182
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,303
You probably also want me to love you?

183
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:51,630
You know, I'm ready.

184
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,950
Because I like you.

185
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,283
Do you hear me? I'm ready, Ajamila. I'm Ready.

186
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,220
I will be very happy if you wear this.

187
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,155
For me?

188
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,145
How lovely!

189
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:20,145
Thank you.

190
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:26,378
Why are you silent? Do you hear me?

191
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,910
No… No!

192
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,699
Well, no then.

193
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:39,699
Run home.

194
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:49,209
And if you change your mind, and want
to find me... you'll find

195
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,880
only…

196
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,540
what?

197
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,209
Money

198
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,879
what?

199
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,030
Money. Coins. My love costs something.

200
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:12,537
And if you don't find it - no need,
Brahman Ajamila.

201
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:30,740
God! God! Is this a dream? No

202
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,799
Did this happen to me?

203
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:37,119
I have my wife Kamali! Father... My path!

204
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,166
What's happening to me?

205
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:20,295
Ajamila?! Where have you been? I almost died…

206
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,960
Ajamila. What's wrong with you?
What happened?

207
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,874
Nothing happened.

208
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,620
Where were you?

209
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,679
Collecting wood, flowers.

210
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,240
Why did it take so long?

211
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,260
Long? No, I was quick.

212
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,280
Still, Ajamila, why so long?

213
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:45,279
Nothing happened!
It just turned out that way.

214
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,037
Nothing happened!

215
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:52,818
Everything is fine with me!
Fine! All is good!

216
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:02,004
Ajamila!

217
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:03,956
Brahman Ajamila!

218
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,851
I know you have money!

219
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:11,601
There! Give it to me,
and you'll get something in return…

220
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,942
I'm ready, Ajamila. Ready.

221
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:08,400
Come to me! Forget everyone.

222
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Now you have only me in your life!

223
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,579
I will give you what you've never experienced.

224
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,779
Just come to me…

225
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,985
Why didn't we meet earlier?
We are made for each other.

226
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,586
Didn't you realize that after our meeting?

227
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:35,586
I am your fate. I am your real life…

228
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:38,948
My embrace is gentler than your wife's.

229
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:42,852
Right, Ajamila? Don't deceive yourself.

230
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:46,618
I am much more skilled in love than she is.

231
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,000
And how sweet are my lips!
What are you waiting for?

232
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,154
Taste them!

233
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,177
Prabhu, are you awake?

234
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:55,567
Why aren't you getting up?
Are you waiting for me?

235
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,957
Yes.

236
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,437
Kamali, get up, we need
to perform the ritual today.

237
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,183
We need to prepare.

238
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:08,563
Yes, we do!

239
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,689
You probably also want me to love you?

240
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:50,331
You know, I'm ready. Because I like you.

241
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,510
Do you hear me?

242
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,815
Ajamila!

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,220
Purnahuti

244
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,000
The Lord joyfully entered your home.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,718
Let him stay here forever,

246
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:15,255
and bring prosperity and peace with him.

247
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,913
I am your destiny. I am your real life…

248
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,986
Your blessings warm my heart.

249
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:21,986
Thank you for them…

250
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:25,522
And you are a lucky man!
You have such a son — Ajamila!

251
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,913
My embrace is gentler than your wife's embrace.

252
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,727
Right, Ajamila?

253
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,779
Yes... Ajamila is my hope!

254
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,633
I want him to become better than me.

255
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,950
What are you waiting for? Taste them!

256
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,240
Ajamila!.. Ajamila!

257
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,179
Good sign, Ajamila!

258
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,652
The Lord sends us a good sign.

259
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,520
By the way!

260
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:19,242
To you and your son,
with heartfelt gratitude, Lochan Babu.

261
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,570
Money! Money… Coins…!

262
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,100
My love costs something…

263
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:35,793
…He will have beautiful eyes like yours…

264
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:38,221
And let the chin be like his grandfather's.

265
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:39,660
Okay.

266
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,362
He will have beautiful long fingers…

267
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:45,510
And when he grows up, he will be tall,
even taller than you…

268
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:50,600
Kamali, do you really think this is possible?

269
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,326
My mother always said,

270
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:55,278
that parents should first imagine their child,

271
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,009
and only then give birth.

272
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,181
The Lord will definitely give us such a son,

273
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,502
as we create in our minds.

274
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:06,252
Ajamila, it's actually so simple!

275
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,228
Well… maybe…

276
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,839
Let's sit down here!

277
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:16,000
Madhava, Gopala… Narayana!

278
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,108
That's what we will call him, Ajamila…

279
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,000
Our son…

280
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,182
Our little one… our treasure.

281
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:28,732
Narayana. It's so affectionate. My Narayana!

282
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,220
Have you already imagined him?

283
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,610
Of course! I imagine him well.

284
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,081
How do you manage that?

285
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,351
What?

286
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:42,638
Well… imagining, what his eyes,
what his hands will be like.

287
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,665
what name we'll give him.

288
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:52,783
I just close my eyes and see all this…

289
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:14,087
Kamali, dear, let's go home.

290
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,626
Home, why? We are having such a good time walking.

291
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,808
I'm feeling unwell.

292
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:25,808
Something feels not right…

293
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,560
Is your head hurting?

294
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,800
Prabhu, do you even hear me?

295
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,970
Huh? What? Ah… I hear you, I hear.

296
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,762
Yes, I hear you…

297
00:25:54,509 --> 00:26:00,909
Now everything will be fine.
You will feel better soon.

298
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,860
Just lie down a bit, and you'll feel better.

299
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:28,608
Oh Lord, what's happening to me?

300
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,833
This has never happened before.

301
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,440
Why can't I get her out of my head?

302
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,708
I don't want this! Where is my mind?

303
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:38,951
Where is my piety? What am I doing?

304
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,390
It's not too late to stop!

305
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:44,470
My wife, my Kamali, I can't treat her like this.

306
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:48,413
You probably also want to be with me
here in the forest, where no one sees us?

307
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:51,100
Because you like me…

308
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:53,385
…And if you want to find me, you will….

309
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,270
…My love costs something….

310
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:54,400
Forgive me… I can't… Her hands… Voice… I can't…

311
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,936
Well, you know, if you have money - come in, but if not…

312
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Not today, but there will be tomorrow… You know that.

313
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:52,484
When you have some, then you can come…

314
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,842
You can't treat me like this,

315
00:28:56,842 --> 00:29:00,220
I won't leave you today,
I've left everything to come to you…

316
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,080
Let me go! It hurts!

317
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,354
Let me go… And stop acting like a prude!

318
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,930
Let her go!

319
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,130
Who are you?

320
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,590
Well, come in since you've come. I've been waiting!

321
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,169
Now I understand why you didn't want to let me in!

322
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,759
You were waiting for this… Brahman…

323
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,554
And what about you?

324
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:36,974
Me? Oh, I will leave and never come back again.

325
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:40,450
And you… Very soon

326
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,100
…Will turn into… .

327
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,750
Well?

328
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,040
You'll become an old woman no one needs!

329
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:50,660
Be happy, Brahman.

330
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:55,789
We'll meet again.

331
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,480
Well, hello, Brahman Ajamila.

332
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Hello… uh…

333
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,940
Varsha. That's my name.

334
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,750
Hello, Varsha.

335
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,630
I thought Brahmans sleep at this time.

336
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,309
But look, Brahmans are fully awake and wandering.

337
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:29,700
So…

338
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,505
You're not in a hurry?

339
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:39,679
Well then, I am not in a hurry either… Let's go…

340
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:13,191
Ajamila…

341
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,691
Well, come to me…

342
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,377
Ajamila!

343
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:41,609
Yes, Gurudev…

344
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,121
Once long ago, I asked you…

345
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:48,944
Are you ready to follow
the principles of religion to the end of your life

346
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:51,405
…What did you answer me then?

347
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:54,040
That I am ready, Gurudev…

348
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:06,510
Ajamila...

349
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:44,645
Ajamila, is that all? What else?

350
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:47,530
You were gone almost a day,

351
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,250
you come and calmly go to sleep?

352
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,549
Did you forget anything?

353
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:59,254
No, Ajamila.
Now you will explain everything to me.

354
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,571
Where have you been?

355
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:04,982
Why did you make me and your wife worry?

356
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,696
And where is the money that was donated to us?

357
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,167
It was my money!

358
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,070
I earned it! And now forget it!

359
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,704
There's no more money.

360
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,640
How dare you raise your voice at me?

361
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:21,029
Leave me alone!

362
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:35,342
Let's go, daughter…

363
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,560
Let it be…

364
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:54,318
Where were you?
And where is the money that was donated to us?

365
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,909
It was my money, I earned it,

366
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,024
forget about it, there's no more money!
Leave me alone!

367
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:03,261
Father!

368
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:07,060
You left me early in the morning,
and now look — it's noon.

369
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,410
Only a little time has passed…

370
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,770
I wanted to sleep, but I couldn't.
They didn't let me...

371
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,910
Who didn't let you?

372
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,531
Well... father... and... wife.

373
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,360
Whose wife?

374
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,133
Mine.

375
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:26,883
So you're married?

376
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,293
Yes, but it's nothing serious.

377
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:38,047
Well, if it's not serious for you,
it's even less so for me.

378
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:05,148
So, you have a family... Good...

379
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:07,010
And what did you tell them?

380
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,530
What could I tell them?

381
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,050
Do you not care?

382
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,311
...Probably not.

383
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:21,139
Though now it's easier.

384
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,968
Just three days ago,
it was very hard for me.

385
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,895
But then something changed.

386
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,480
Something inside me burned out.

387
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:31,382
I no longer want to think
and weigh every step.

388
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,626
And to be afraid of what others will say.

389
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,529
I've done that my whole life.

390
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:40,634
I want to breathe freely,
to live without fear and remorse.

391
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:45,400
After that meeting with you...
there, in the forest...

392
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:49,990
I couldn't think of anything else but you.

393
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,720
Neither my family nor my duties,

394
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,229
— nothing could make me forget you...

395
00:37:56,229 --> 00:38:01,530
your hands... your voice... your eyes...

396
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,881
I don't want to play the role of
a faithful husband and loving son,

397
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,975
when here inside me is a burning fire.

398
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:09,560
I can't, and I don't want to...

399
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,526
I just want to be with you...

400
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,760
only with you...

401
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:19,419
So what... have you fallen in love with me?

402
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:20,716
Yes...

403
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,921
Have you really found something special in me?

404
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,994
Oh! You don't even know how wonderful you are!

405
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:28,369
You are my perfection.

406
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,869
You are life itself to me!

407
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,381
I just can't live without you!

408
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,020
I want to be only with you... only with you...

409
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:45,208
Where is he?

410
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:47,699
I just saw Ajamila...

411
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,060
He went into the house of a well-known harlot.

412
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:54,632
I thought so.

413
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,375
Will you follow him?

414
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:03,746
No. He couldn't be held back by a young wife,

415
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:07,680
nor by the path of religion he has followed for so long.

416
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,660
If he has made his choice, what can I do?

417
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,390
It's all my fault.

418
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:21,591
I invested everything I had in Ajamila.

419
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,430
But he made his own choice.

420
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,000
In an instant, the Lord rid me of my pride,

421
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,020
my hopes, my expectations...

422
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:43,060
My good name...

423
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,200
All I can do now is pray
that the Lord doesn't leave him.

424
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:19,204
So what are we going to do?

425
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,589
What do you mean?

426
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:23,356
You've been living with me
for several days now...

427
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,119
Your money has long run out.

428
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,520
And you don't have any new money.

429
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:34,837
And all my... admirers...
You chased them away...

430
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:41,422
If you're worried about money,
that's not a problem for me.

431
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:46,721
Really? That's good news.

432
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:52,699
Yes. It was never a problem for me.

433
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,415
And where will we live?

434
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,175
Live?..

435
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,870
We can live at my place.

436
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,830
I will bring you to my house.

437
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,373
You'll have a separate room.

438
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,180
If you agree to be with me -
I'll provide for you.

439
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:27,331
Tell me, do Brahmans chant something every day?

440
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:29,840
You have some mantras, don't you?

441
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,030
Three times a day…

442
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,300
A hymn to praise the Sun God…

443
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,000
Three times a day.
And when was the last time you chanted them?

444
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,539
Well, probably last week.

445
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:52,198
And that was the last time.

446
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:55,795
Because then you found love?

447
00:41:58,561 --> 00:42:02,168
Oh come on, I really do love you.

448
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:07,216
Love... I believe...
You don't just give up everything like that...

449
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,118
And I don't...

450
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:11,440
Okay, okay. I understand...

451
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,210
Tell your family that I am... a maid.

452
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,595
If they believe it, of course.

453
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:21,470
Tell your wife...

454
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,150
Although, say whatever you want...

455
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:28,619
But remember, I won't work for you.

456
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,906
You will be the one bringing money to me...

457
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:35,270
For my love... Got it?

458
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:41,650
We still have time...
how shall we spend it?

459
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:47,691
Come up to me, I'll whisper it in your ear.

460
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:51,633
You know how much I adore you...

461
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:37,431
Ajamila... You have come!
You have returned!

462
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:39,242
Is this your wife?

463
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:44,957
Prabhu... Who is this woman?

464
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,990
Kamali, meet Varsha.

465
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,650
Why has she come to our house?

466
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,853
She will help you with the household.

467
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,090
Prabhu, am I not managing by myself?

468
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:15,124
So what, I am going to live here?

469
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:20,466
Yes...

470
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,880
And... she... where will she live?

471
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,030
There...

472
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,362
Ajamila, I need a bed here.

473
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:36,010
I need shelves for clothes,
and boxes for jewelry.

474
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,887
You will buy me jewelry, won't you?

475
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,850
I remember, you promised…

476
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:45,825
And tell her not to hover over me.

477
00:44:45,825 --> 00:44:50,065
This is now my home too.
And we will live here together.

478
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:55,961
Wait... Where are you going to?

479
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,284
Now, every time she wants to cry,

480
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:01,303
you'll run to comfort her?

481
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,859
Do you think that's normal?

482
00:45:04,152 --> 00:45:06,162
She is my wife!

483
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,855
And so? I need attention too.

484
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:13,613
You don't want me to get upset, do you?

485
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:17,077
Alright

486
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:27,662
I want to spend this night in the yard.

487
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:34,291
I can no longer and do not want
to stay in this house.

488
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,600
Bring out a bed for me.

489
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:45,014
Ajamila, come to your father.

490
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,290
What is it, father?

491
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:57,003
My time has come, there is no one else
for me to think about but the Lord.

492
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,770
And I won't stay here anymore.

493
00:46:02,965 --> 00:46:08,865
I will leave... I hope
it will be easier for you.

494
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,683
Let's go, daughter...

495
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,800
Ajamila, it's getting dark.
It's time for us to go to bed.

496
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:38,171
And you know -
I need all your attention and care.

497
00:46:41,476 --> 00:46:46,237
Alright. Ajamila,
I am waiting for you...

498
00:46:48,335 --> 00:46:49,717
I am waiting for you…

499
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,971
Father... Father... why?

500
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:09,551
It hurts so much!
It is so painful for me!

501
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,221
The stars are so beautiful tonight!

502
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,695
They have always been like this,
as long as I can remember.

503
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:50,000
I look at them every day.

504
00:47:51,627 --> 00:47:55,300
My days are not like one another,

505
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,930
but the stars always remain the same.

506
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:09,108
Oh Supreme Lord, Master of my life,

507
00:48:09,108 --> 00:48:14,200
You are unchanging,
like the stars in the sky.

508
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,279
And unchanging is Your love for us.

509
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:25,410
Yet we, blinded by our own pain,

510
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:31,949
cannot see Your love in our lives...

511
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:38,646
Oh my Narayana, oh Merciful One,

512
00:48:39,134 --> 00:48:42,042
I ask You,

513
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:46,869
help me to open my heart

514
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:52,039
enter into it...
I am waiting for You...

515
00:48:54,716 --> 00:48:58,310
Who is there?

516
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:04,887
My Lord, is it You?

517
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:11,411
I see You... I recognize You!

518
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:16,754
How beautiful You are...

519
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:22,748
You have come for me...

520
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:36,766
You Yourself have come for me!..
I am ready to go.

521
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:58,775
Father! Father! Father!
Father! Father! Father!

522
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:25,131
Your father died last night.

523
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:30,974
Father!

524
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:36,278
I pray to the Almighty that He gives you
spiritual wisdom and strength

525
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:39,677
to never stray from the path of
righteousness and virtue.

526
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,632
Do not leave me, I need your strength.

527
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,458
My blessings will never leave you, son,

528
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:53,040
you can always count on me.

529
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,770
And you will come to see me
in the ashram, won't you?

530
00:50:55,770 --> 00:51:00,400
Of course, son... We will see
each other constantly.

531
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,695
That's good, that's so good!

532
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:13,215
Father! What have I done?

533
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:17,685
...what have I done...

534
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,661
Not only your father died tonight...

535
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,292
Tonight, your wife also died.

536
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:28,986
What?.. What are you saying, Kamali?..

537
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:34,416
The Kamali who once married Ajamila,
a man of duty and honor

538
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:37,280
No longer exists.

539
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:42,054
I can no longer stay here...

540
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:44,273
I want to leave.

541
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:51,101
Are you letting me go?

542
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:09,440
I let you go... Kamali...

543
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:15,548
Thank you, Prabhu. Please forgive me.

544
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:22,567
I couldn't be the wife you deserved.

545
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:25,772
No... you were everything to me...

546
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:35,367
Kamali... Kamali...

547
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:41,790
Forgive me if you can.

548
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:12,124
We've run out of money.

549
00:54:13,638 --> 00:54:17,114
I know, you've told me already.

550
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,639
And I need something from the clothes.

551
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:30,425
Yesterday, they gave me a piece of fabric, a pot of oil, and five silver coins.

552
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,708
What can we give to the temple from this?

553
00:54:33,726 --> 00:54:35,326
I think, three coins.

554
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:41,691
Take these coins and give them to the head priest.

555
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:42,878
Yes, father.

556
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:48,277
Daughter, will two coins and a pot of oil last us a week?

557
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,902
Of course, father.

558
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:55,920
What shall we do?

559
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:03,734
I don't know, I'll go now and think of something.

560
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:06,109
Will you think of something?

561
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:09,314
Maybe it's better I think of something?

562
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:12,843
Maybe I should invite someone over?

563
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:14,625
What?

564
00:55:16,656 --> 00:55:20,233
Drop it! Figured it out! No guests!

565
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:25,170
I'll provide for you! And forget about your old craft!

566
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:12,592
Do you think this junk is worth anything?

567
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,683
Doubtful.

568
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:21,772
Then why do you need it?

569
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,508
I'll try to exchange it for a measure of rice.

570
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:26,793
A measure of rice!

571
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:33,705
Listen, dear, besides rice, do you plan to feed me anything else?

572
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:44,035
Could have brought home some fresh fish...

573
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:47,781
Varsha, I've told you so many times!

574
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:51,981
What about Varsha, what? You don't want fish, fine.

575
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:53,931
But I do!

576
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:59,675
Fried... a bit spicy... mmm, it's so delicious...

577
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:07,034
Here's what I'll tell you, Ajamila.

578
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:09,453
A month is a long time.

579
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:11,942
Somehow we lived through it together.

580
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,727
And I plan to keep living.

581
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:17,094
But I intend to live...

582
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,057
not like this...

583
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:22,354
What are you implying?

584
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:27,213
When I was alone, I only relied on myself.

585
00:57:28,102 --> 00:57:32,998
But now I have you. So, be kind, provide for me.

586
00:57:34,267 --> 00:57:36,783
Especially since...

587
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:40,906
I'll have to eat more soon...

588
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:44,271
Why? Planning to gain weight?

589
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,713
No, but I must...

590
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

591
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:55,398
We're going to have a child.
A little Ajamila.

592
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:05,729
Kamali, my girl, you've been living
with us for a year now

593
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:09,012
Did you ever feel hungry or in need?

594
00:58:09,012 --> 00:58:10,450
Of course not, father.

595
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,284
I'm completely satisfied with my life.

596
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,974
I don't need money.

597
00:58:13,974 --> 00:58:16,500
I love you both with all my heart

598
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,157
You are my treasure

599
00:58:19,273 --> 00:58:20,406
but...

600
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:22,933
But what?

601
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:26,017
Just that this Brahman,
the righteous Ajamila

602
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:28,209
simply cannot
give me a son.

603
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,264
Did you hear that,
righteous Brahman?

604
00:58:32,264 --> 00:58:34,029
Alright, alright, father!

605
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:36,870
You'll have grandchildren.
Lots of them.

606
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:38,820
Well, say something?

607
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,666
You don't know where
babies come from?

608
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:44,848
Or do you think you
didn't take part in this?

609
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:49,867
No, just... yes...

610
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,905
I'm happy Varsha, very happy...
Very happy.

611
00:58:55,556 --> 00:58:57,285
I always wanted a son...

612
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:59,968
Really?
Are you telling me the truth?

613
00:59:00,192 --> 00:59:02,636
You always wanted a son?

614
00:59:03,343 --> 00:59:07,318
I promise, you will have a son
when the time comes. Just...

615
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:13,532
A single grain of rice won't be enough.
You understand me, Ajamila?

616
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:32,700
Look what I have...
Please, buy it...

617
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:40,881
It's for puja, paraphernalia...
Maybe you'll buy? No...

618
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:45,577
Look... it's very cheap...

619
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:51,545
Look, good paraphernalia.
Almost new... Buy them?!

620
00:59:57,414 --> 00:59:59,803
Dear sir!

621
01:00:00,983 --> 01:00:04,669
I want to offer you
a very valuable item.

622
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,997
Well, if you don't want it,
nevermind. I'll go.

623
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:19,130
Wait... Ajamila, is that you?!

624
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:23,294
Haven't seen you in a while

625
01:00:23,326 --> 01:00:27,197
but I heard...
about your wife, father

626
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,409
but I understand...

627
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,502
You don't understand...

628
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:34,875
No one understands me!

629
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:36,921
When I was good
in people's eyes,

630
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:38,760
everyone greeted me,
were happy to see me.

631
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,760
Hello, Ajamila!
Will you perform a ritual for us?

632
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:44,772
But when I started living the way
I want, what happened?

633
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:47,772
Everyone stopped even looking
at me! Afraid of sin!

634
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:52,058
Yes, I am living
with the woman I love,

635
01:00:52,058 --> 01:00:54,160
and want to be happy with her!

636
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,160
So what? Universal hatred?

637
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,984
Everyone wanted the right Ajamila,

638
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:02,001
but I want to be myself!

639
01:01:02,156 --> 01:01:05,156
Can I do anything
for you, Ajamila?

640
01:01:08,088 --> 01:01:10,603
Buy this from me.

641
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,443
You have no money?

642
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,011
Please just buy.
I'll get food for my family.

643
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:21,362
That's why I came here.

644
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:27,503
Please take it.

645
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:34,404
Thank you.

646
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:12,742
There!

647
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:24,374
Fish... So much... Why?

648
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,435
Why? You asked for fish!

649
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:32,511
Fry some fish for yourself,
Varsha. And for me...

650
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:36,203
Did I hear that right?

651
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,548
You heard right.

652
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,030
You're changing, Ajamila.

653
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,652
You never used to eat fish...
What happened?

654
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,388
A new Ajamila has appeared.

655
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,830
The old one is gone.

656
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:15,573
So, how was your day? Successful?

657
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:35,099
Although, you don't have to say,
your face says it all.

658
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:42,597
Was today successful?

659
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,579
Absolutely!

660
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:59,122
Dear sir, are you playing fair?

661
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,822
You want to insult me,
esteemed one?

662
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:04,321
Honesty is my middle name!

663
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,768
Well then, let's play.

664
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Now we're talking!
And do you have money?

665
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,182
Of course, I do.

666
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,916
Dice don't like playing for nothing!
Dice need respect!

667
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,195
So, shall we play?

668
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,157
I've won!

669
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,704
Alright! You're lucky today.
Move aside, let another try.

670
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:50,467
I want to play too!
I'll bet one coin!

671
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,300
Alright... let's go!

672
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,681
Well done...

673
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,002
Brother, you're lucky today...

674
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,711
One more time!

675
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,556
If only luck would come my way...

676
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,534
Maybe I should play too?
Maybe I'll get lucky?

677
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:46,082
Ah, pity I didn't bring money...
I would have played too...

678
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:51,688
Well...well...well...
What did he roll?

679
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:56,427
Ah, he lost!
I knew it, he's a loser.

680
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:59,355
Tough luck for you...

681
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:02,447
It's alright, honorable one,
next time you'll get luck...

682
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:05,614
Let's get out of here, why stand,
gawking? Let's go.

683
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,171
Come on, hold on...

684
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,917
Money and greed -
a beautiful combination,

685
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:19,247
when you know how to use them.

686
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,502
How's our baby?

687
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:26,146
He's moving non-stop.

688
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,831
Married to a Brahmin.
Who would imagine?

689
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,481
Good day, pilgrims.

690
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,849
Peace be upon you, good sir.

691
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,849
Where are you heading?

692
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,419
We're visiting holy places.

693
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,419
Heading to blessed Prayag now.

694
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:03,015
Our pilgrimage has come to an end.

695
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,647
Let's rest today, take a bath,
and tomorrow... tomorrow we will

696
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,723
perform auspicious rituals
and feed the Brahmins.

697
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:11,723
Right! To mark the end
of our journey!

698
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:15,887
As the sacred texts say.

699
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:26,012
Why are you, a healthy man, leading
the blind and give them your time?

700
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,609
You're like in prison with them!

701
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,369
You're not your own master.

702
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,219
Walking with them, caring for them.

703
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,923
You can't leave them even for a minute.

704
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,958
What else is human life for?
If not to help others and serve the Lord?

705
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,024
How else should we our time?

706
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,328
Time should be spent wisely.
Not wandering aimlessly.

707
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,322
These people are my destiny.

708
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:49,293
Together, we visit holy places
and pray to the Lord.

709
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,890
Dad, you're a Brahmin yourself,

710
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,318
are you going to give
gifts to yourself?

711
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,223
Even though we're Brahmins,
we too must engage in charity

712
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:11,979
and use all money for
serving the Lord and holy people.

713
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:17,066
Now let's check your bags,

714
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,501
shake your clothes a little.

715
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:23,375
Maybe a coin will jingle!

716
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:26,653
No! These people will leave in peace!
And we won't touch anyone!

717
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:29,797
What? Can't do it yourself,
don't stop us.

718
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,394
Look at the brahmin one...

719
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:46,211
So, so... aha... what's this?
Come on, let's see...

720
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:50,993
Come on, show me, what's in your bag?

721
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:57,351
Maybe hiding something
in your turban? Come on, show it!

722
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,622
Aha, what about you?

723
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:05,179
You too, turn around.

724
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,199
Look at this, said
they were poor pilgrims!

725
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,390
Look, I found a coin too.

726
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,899
Look at that, not bad...

727
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,873
Here you go...
Alright, go now...

728
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:44,292
Ajamila, what in the world?

729
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,946
In our profession, your cowardice
can cost a life.

730
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:51,362
Either you're with us or
go to hell.

731
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:55,811
So?

732
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,754
Okay...

733
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,534
Okay what?

734
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,941
I'm with you...

735
00:11:14,145 --> 00:11:18,152
That's good, Ajamila.
But remember...

736
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,451
There won't be a second time.
0:11:38.003,0:11:39.262
Brahman

737
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,642
Who are you?

738
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:45,601
Om Tat Sat

739
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:49,491
Swaha. Purnahuti.

740
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,544
Leave them! Empty...

741
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:04,918
Om Tat Sat

742
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,872
Om Tat Sat

743
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:16,770
Let's better go to Prayag!

744
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:23,507
Of cource, on foot

745
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,061
Got is with us

746
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:34,107
Brahman, now robber...

747
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:38,525
With a knife. And they're pilgrims...

748
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:43,186
Damn me, brahmand Ajamila!

749
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,783
Damn me!

750
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,066
Who invented that wine?

751
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:37,340
It's tough with it, and without.

752
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:41,088
What, can't get yesterday's
blind men out of your head?

753
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,791
It was hard for me at first too.

754
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,820
How can it be - they're
holy pilgrims, and we rob them.

755
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:53,746
And then?

756
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:57,307
Then I got used to it, it became easier.

757
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,324
It's my job, and their fate.

758
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,911
The past doesn't let go easily.

759
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,445
It will let go.

760
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:13,441
Yeah, the sooner the better.

761
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,840
Give me the money!

762
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:34,623
Do you hear me? Or I'll finish off
your whole miserable family!

763
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:36,905
Where's the money, I said!

764
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:08,912
This is for you.

765
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,625
Where did you get it?

766
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,722
Doesn't matter. It's for you.

767
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:44,324
I know you didn't buy it.

768
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,125
But you know I can't
wear this on the streets.

769
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,604
Someone will surely recognize
their jewelry.

770
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,695
Then why did you bring it?

771
00:15:56,452 --> 00:16:00,095
Listen, your craft is
becoming very dangerous.

772
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,510
The town is buzzing with talk
about robbers in the forest.

773
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,233
The king has already sent
a squad of his best warriors,

774
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:10,655
to catch the robbers
and bring them to trial.

775
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:13,963
And the king has already come up with
most terrible punishment for them...

776
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,191
What is that?

777
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:18,448
The king ordered the robbers
have their hands and feet severed.

778
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:21,572
But spare their lifes
as a warning to others.

779
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:33,141
So better get rid of them...
Give them to jewelers to melt it down.

780
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:50,508
Kamali... is that you?

781
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,609
Kamali... how... why...

782
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:11,419
Sir, you're mistaken.
That woman is dead.

783
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,206
I'm just a simple beggar.

784
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:17,776
Sir, we're just beggars.

785
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:22,314
Go on your way.
You don't belong here.

786
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:46,719
Ajamila, Kamali's fate
is on your head...

787
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:49,937
Don't forget that...

788
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:54,514
Sir, you're mistaken.
That woman is dead...

789
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:40,908
Hello Varsha.

790
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,205
I see... brought the debt?

791
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,094
Yes, of course!

792
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,333
Good! What else?

793
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,624
I missed you.

794
00:21:58,545 --> 00:22:02,369
Missed me? Maybe also say
you're crazy about me,

795
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:04,648
And that you can't live
without me?

796
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:05,515
Exactly.

797
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:11,508
So maybe you'll even
marry me, huh?

798
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:31,665
Maybe you'll let
an old friend inside?

799
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,510
What if Ajamila comes?

800
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,405
He won't come.

801
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:47,307
But what if he does?

802
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:49,794
He won't come.

803
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,959
Father, look
how beautiful it is here!

804
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:15,645
What... what are you doing?

805
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,740
Wait! Wait! I'll give you
all the money!

806
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,870
Son, my boy...

807
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:26,399
He's dead. You killed him.

808
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,271
What makes you say that?

809
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:33,241
Hey! Get up! Wake up!

810
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,962
Wake up, open your eyes...

811
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:43,778
...I didn't mean to...

812
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:45,762
didn't mean to...

813
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:49,441
no... no... not this...

814
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,100
His wife and children are waiting...
Do you have children?

815
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:04,126
Dad, are you leaving already?

816
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:06,883
Will you bring gifts?

817
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:15,556
Will you take this money
to your family?

818
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:18,518
Don't start moralizing me!
Don't talk to me about ethics!

819
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,983
I know everything myself!
I didn't mean to kill! Didn't want to!

820
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:25,855
I only need money!
Nothing else! Just the money!

821
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:31,968
I don't need your miserable lives!
I don't need anything! Nothing!

822
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,654
Will you take this money to your family?
Do you think they'll be happier?

823
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:44,312
You want to make some happy,
by killing and bringing grief to others?

824
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,395
Well, I'm out... I have to go...

825
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:05,777
Yes, of course.

826
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,631
Here, take this.

827
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
I think we'll have another son.

828
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:43,600
What, Ajamila? We already
have so many sons.

829
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,927
I want us to have a daughter.

830
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:50,254
And we'll name her... Kumari.

831
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:54,728
In honor of
Lord Mahadeva's wife, right?

832
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,122
Prabhu, I respect the sages,

833
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:05,440
but I'd really love our son
to have the name of the Lord

834
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:05,997
but...

835
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:08,997
No! Don't argue! The name of God!

836
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:11,594
Please. Don't argue.

837
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,132
Alright, alright.

838
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:27,579
Madhava... Gopala... Narayana!

839
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,475
What Narayana?

840
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,482
That will be his name, Ajamila...
Our son...

841
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,049
Our little boy...
Our treasure.

842
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,722
Narayana!

843
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,187
No.

844
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:46,106
Our son's name will be Narayana...
That will bring us luck.

845
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:51,627
Ajamila, if you want
to philosophize, go outside.

846
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:54,032
I will sleep.

847
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,937
Dad! Dad! You're back!

848
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,991
I love you my boy!

849
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,454
I love you too, dad.

850
00:28:18,077 --> 00:28:19,434
Where are your brothers?

851
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,995
They went to the river.

852
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,037
Why didn't you go with them?

853
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:26,037
I's boring with them.
I was waiting for you, dad.

854
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:48,727
Dad, dad catch!

855
00:28:54,675 --> 00:29:00,003
Dad, come on throw it… come on…
Dad, seriously...

856
00:29:03,764 --> 00:29:06,389
Dad, that's not fair!

857
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:09,643
Always be on guard!
Then you can win!

858
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,405
Why are you so sad, dad?

859
00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:48,357
Nothing... all fine.

860
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:52,245
...I'll go...
take some rest...

861
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:15,735
Ajamila…. Why did you do that…
You killed me, Ajamila…

862
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:24,282
Be damned… Are you happy now?
Ajamila… Ajamila…

863
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:30,979
Why did you do that?
Now you will have a different life…

864
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:35,232
Come with us… Ajamila….

865
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:36,812
Don't touch me!

866
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:38,834
You robbed me...
You betrayed me!

867
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:43,550
Leave me alone…
I didn't mean to kill you…

868
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:47,025
Don't touch... Murderer...

869
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,119
Stop, go away!

870
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:55,231
I didn't want to, didn't want to!

871
00:30:55,427 --> 00:31:01,879
Be damned...
Why...

872
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:38,238
What happened, son?

873
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:43,579
You fainted. And mom said
that you had a stroke...

874
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:55,069
Narayana, my boy!
Do not leave me.

875
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:58,170
I'm scared!

876
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,562
I love you Narayana

877
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:07,440
I love your mom
your brothers

878
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:14,069
Out of love for you
I've done many things...

879
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:17,963
which is why I'm so scared now…

880
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:23,585
Money! Where's the money?
Give me the money!

881
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:26,848
Or I'll finisy all your
miserable family!!

882
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:31,017
Where is the money I ask?
I need more! Give me all the money!

883
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:59,644
Would the Lord do that for me?
Father, did you hear?

884
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,470
I will not leave this path!

885
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,166
Never? Never!

886
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:08,031
And you will get something in return...
It's all my fault...

887
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:10,521
Well come to me...

888
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,945
Sir, you are mistaken.
That woman died.

889
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:17,225
Go bring me rice, fish, vegetables -
I have nothing to feed the children!

890
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:21,251
I hate you, I hate you!!
Hate you! Hate you!!

891
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:26,390
You, it's because of you!

892
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:30,903
Shut up! Better remember
who came to me first.

893
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:34,108
Who told me about love?
Promised something?

894
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:37,108
Brought me money
5 silver coins?

895
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,218
Who searched for me all night
like a madman?

896
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:43,218
Who brought me here?

897
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:49,009
It was you, Ajamila, you!
So you better shut it!

898
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:53,459
I just helped you to fulfill
what you dreamed of!

899
00:33:58,394 --> 00:34:01,394
Dad, is everything okay?

900
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:06,056
Too late.

901
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,890
It's too late to change anything.

902
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,720
My life is coming to an end.

903
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:30,109
I've done too much
that won't let me die in peace.

904
00:35:36,294 --> 00:35:39,294
Yes. A little...

905
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,757
Where are you going?

906
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:53,082
Money won't fall from the sky on us.

907
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:57,949
Yes, that's for sure.

908
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,644
Thief! Thief! Get out of here!
Murderer! Go away! Thief!

909
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:46,747
That's the same godless man!
Look at this rascal!

910
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,917
Thief! Thief! This is not a place for you!

911
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:53,510
Came with a child and thinks
everyone will forget about what he did?

912
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:57,048
Get out! Get out of here!
Go where you were going!

913
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,048
This is not a place for you!

914
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:02,390
Who do you think we are?
Don't even come near us!

915
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,390
Go, go! Get away from here!
Look what he's thinking!

916
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,763
Leave! You've completely lost your mind!
This is our place! This is our place!

917
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:12,123
This is our place! Rascal!
There's nothing for you here! Yes Yes!

918
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:15,431
Why did they drive us away?
Why do they hate you so much?

919
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:18,607
...this is their place, son.
We're not welcomed there.

920
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:23,370
so what? No one can claim the road
for themselves. It is public!

921
00:37:24,223 --> 00:37:30,056
It's okay, son. It's okay.
I'll sit by myself. You go.

922
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:37,501
You go.

923
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,279
I can stay with you, dad.

924
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:45,610
I won't be bored.
I will sing. Sa! Re! Ha! Ma!

925
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:50,175
No, son, you better go.

926
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,854
Come back for me in the evening.

927
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:56,481
I need to be alone...

928
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:03,087
Okay, dad. I will go.
Wait for me, don't get lonely.

929
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:09,267
Hello, beggar Ajamila!

930
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:12,743
Today your new life begins.

931
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,247
Is it hard for you, Ajamila?

932
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:01,333
You are not young anymore...
Must have seen a lot, haven't you?

933
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,506
Yes, I've seen a lot.

934
00:39:06,435 --> 00:39:11,218
You wanted happiness, but instead
you're afraid to look people in the eye.

935
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,572
I know...

936
00:39:14,572 --> 00:39:16,849
You chose this life for yourself.

937
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:19,849
...stop it!
Why are you tormenting me?

938
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:23,258
Don't you need help?

939
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:28,159
I'm not young, I have
a heavy burden on my back.

940
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:31,809
Only death will help.

941
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:52,047
Here we are, Ajamila!

942
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,356
We've been waiting for you
for so long!

943
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:03,789
Who, who are you?

944
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:09,726
Your new friends!..
Don't be afraid of us!...

945
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,880
What do you want from me?

946
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:20,611
Where are you going, we haven't
properly introduced ourselves yet.

947
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:25,721
No, no... Where... Don't...
Where are you dragging me?

948
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:31,653
Home! To the underworld! It's time
appear before Yamaraja's court!

949
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:38,875
No... I haven't finished yet,
I still have so much to do...

950
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,894
All your work is already finished...

951
00:40:45,347 --> 00:40:48,347
I have a family, I have a little son.

952
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:52,404
Narayana!! Narayana!! Narayana!!!

953
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:55,421
Stop!

954
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:57,562
Who are you?

955
00:40:57,562 --> 00:41:01,725
And how dare you interfere with us...
The servants of Yamaraja himself?

956
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:03,793
God of death!

957
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:06,570
We are the messengers of
the Supreme Lord Narayana!

958
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,202
Release this man,
he is no longer in your power!

959
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,908
Release whom, Ajamila?

960
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:17,245
Yes, the Earth did not know
a greater sinner than him.

961
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:24,865
He was a Brahman, but he got involved with
a prostitute and became a thief and murderer!

962
00:41:24,874 --> 00:41:30,044
The darkest, most terrifying regions
of hell await for him!

963
00:41:30,044 --> 00:41:33,044
Ajamila has already atoned for
all his sins!

964
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:37,245
In despair, he spoke
the Holy Name of Lord Narayana!

965
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:42,283
Sins are atoned by tough
austerities and penances!

966
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:47,562
And what he spoke the Holy Name
is accidental!

967
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:52,056
He was just calling his son!
Yes Yes!!

968
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:56,092
Like fire burns dry grass to ashes,

969
00:41:56,103 --> 00:41:59,849
so is the Holy Name of the Lord -
burns away all the sinful reactions,

970
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:03,687
even if it is said unintentionally.

971
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:06,953
You must release this man!

972
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,069
Okay, you win!

973
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:15,078
Well, buddy,
we'll see you soon!

974
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:18,243
We'll come back for you.

975
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,478
Lord... Lord... I've done nothing
worthwile in my entire life,

976
00:42:26,946 --> 00:42:30,962
I only sinned, I only tarnished
the family of Brahmins...

977
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:36,558
But You, You've sent
your great servants,

978
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:42,067
and they were able to save me
from the hands of death. You saved me…

979
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:48,509
I promise you - this old Ajamila
will never forget you again!

980
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:53,979
I promise to never again
return to my past life!

981
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:57,092
Never! Never!

982
00:42:58,088 --> 00:43:01,088
You gave me another chance!

983
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:04,158
Your Holy Name saved me.

984
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:07,799
Your Holy Name is infinitely
merciful…

985
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:15,557
Dad, dad, wait!
The city is the opposite way!

986
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:19,663
I'm leaving, son. I'm leaving to
dedicate my life to the Lord.

987
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:22,779
Lord Narayana?

988
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,934
Yes, son. Lord Narayana.

989
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:29,758
Where will you go?

990
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:32,835
I lived my life in vain,
I spent so many years in sin

991
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,650
Now I am leaving for Haridwar, Narayana.

992
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:40,387
To stay there forever.

993
00:43:40,465 --> 00:43:43,465
And never, never
ever stop serving the Lord...

994
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:49,536
I'm leaving, son.
Goodbye Narayana...

995
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:52,614
Goodbye son...

996
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:18,746
Dad, dad...
