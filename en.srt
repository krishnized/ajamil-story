1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,589
There seem to be
too many poor lately!

2
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,240
What do you mean?

3
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,960
Whoever you stop, you find
nothing of value. Just pennies.

4
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,946
Hey, Ajamila…

5
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,661
You weren’t always like this…

6
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,393
Like what?

7
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:22,110
Well… involved in
what you are doing now.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,195
Why do you ask?

9
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,619
Nothing… Just curious.

10
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:36,275
Yes, there was
a different Ajamila once…

11
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,330
A different life…
everything was different.

12
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,698
And what did you do?

13
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:52,160
I was a Brahmin…
A priest.

14
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:57,141
…and then he rushes to Prahlada,

15
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:00,331
shakes him by the shoulders
and screams:

16
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:03,290
“Where, where is your Vishnu?
Show Him!”

17
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,770
And Prahlada?

18
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,000
Prahlada looks him in the eyes
and replies with a smile:

19
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:15,570
“Dear father, look close and
you’ll see the Lord everywhere.”

20
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,570
And then?

21
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,160
And then Hiranyakashipu screams:

22
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,500
“So, your Vishnu is in my house?”

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,342
Prahlada replies with a smile:

24
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:29,401
“Yes, father, the Lord
is always in our house.”

25
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,080
Then Hiranyakashipu
grabs his sword

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,690
and starts swinging it,
shouting:

27
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,430
“Vishnu! Vishnu!
If You’re here, come out!”

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,100
And when Hiranyakashipu
saw no one,

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,400
he rushed at Prahlada
with his sword, saying:

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,630
“If your Vishnu
doesn’t appear before me now,

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,260
I’ll cut off your head!”

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,135
And Prahlada?

33
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:55,872
Prahlada, this little boy,
tells his father:

34
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,177
“Here He is, my Lord,
right before you.”

35
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:03,080
Hiranyakashipu points
at a piller and yells:

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,778
“Is he in this pillar?”

37
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:07,500
“Yes, father,
can’t you see?”

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,830
Then Hiranyakashipu grabs
his sword and with all his might

39
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,270
strikes the pillar…

40
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,526
But you know, Ajamila,

41
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:20,462
no one heard the sound
of the broken pillar

42
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,560
Why?

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,230
Because at that moment, there was
a deafening roar of a lion,

44
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,100
…and the magnificent
Lord Vishnu appeared.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,200
They fought for a long time
and then Lord Narasimhadev

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,310
grabbed Hiranyakashipu,
put him on his knees

47
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,970
and with his sharp claws
tore him to pieces.

48
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,874
And so saved his
dear devotee Prahlada.

49
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,236
And would the Lord
do the same for me?

50
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,957
Come to me and save me
from demons?

51
00:03:55,957 --> 00:04:01,015
Of course, Ajamila.
The Lord’s love is unchanging.

52
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:05,160
Even if we forget about Him,

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,860
He continues to love us.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,068
And is always ready
to come to our aid.

55
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,567
This… this…
this is so wonderful.

56
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:26,306
Yes, my son.
This is the ultimate truth.

57
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,801
Father, are you okay?

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:35,214
Yes, my boy, I’m fine,
just a bad omen.

59
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,304
Father.

60
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:46,583
What, my boy?

61
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,720
Father, tell Swamiji about
what I asked you today.

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
Ah, yes,

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,840
During our pilgrimage,
Ajamila made an important decision

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,001
He wants to receive
initiation from you.

65
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh Guruji, please
accept me as a disciple.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,029
I ask you for this mercy.

67
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,889
I will not leave this path.

68
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,360
Never?

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,830
Never!

70
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, Lochan Babu,
get your son ready.

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,182
Tomorrow I want
to see him in my ashram.

72
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:30,000
Gurudev, so you have
accepted me?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,442
Of course, my boy.

74
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,110
Father, did you hear?

75
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,287
Yes, my boy, yes,
wonderful!

76
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,699
Ajamila…

77
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:44,820
Yes, Gurudev.

78
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,591
Today marks a wonderful day,
long awaited.

79
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,940
Are you ready to be
devoted to the truth

80
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,919
in all circumstances
of your life,

81
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,000
and be faithful
to the Brahmanical vows?

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,960
I am ready, Gurudev.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,690
Do you promise to follow
the spiritual path

84
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,568
until the end of your days?

85
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,720
I promise, Gurudev

86
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,156
Name me the Brahmanical
qualities you will exhibit.

87
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:11,866
Honesty, purity, ability
to perform austerities,

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,987
calmness, freedom from
anger, all-forgiveness,

89
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:18,250
non-violence towards
any living being.

90
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,465
Ajamila.

91
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,623
Yes, father.

92
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you remember
what you have to do today?

93
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,720
What are you talking about?

94
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,825
Ah, tomorrow we will perform…

95
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,685
Tomorrow at dawn

96
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,539
we will perform
an auspicious ceremony.

97
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,053
Of course, I remember.
I haven’t forgotten at all.

98
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:51,630
So, you should go
to the forest right now

99
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,699
for suitable firewood.

100
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,450
Clean, dry, an elbow’s length…

101
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,306
…pleasant to the eye.

102
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,680
Right.

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Also, you should bring
forest flowers.

104
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,599
Clean, pleasant to the eye,
and with a good fragrance.

105
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,381
Right.
But don’t smell them!

106
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:18,076
Go right now,
you’ll be back by lunchtime.

107
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:22,902
And after lunch, we have
some chores to do.

108
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:43,950
What? Right here?
Right now? Are you sure?

109
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,518
Please! My Goddess!
Do you want me dead?

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,635
Goddess, I am a goddess?
Is this gold?

111
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,540
Gold! All gold!
Yes, Goddess!

112
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:06,410
Take it! All the gold
in the world! All yours!

113
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,456
Please be kind to me!

114
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:10,832
Yes? Goddess!

115
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:14,868
Yes, my fool!

116
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,048
Father, I can’t take it anymore.
Where is he?

117
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,108
…I don’t know.

118
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,872
Father, what should we do?

119
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,640
A whole day has passed,
and he’s still not back.

120
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,741
First, calm down.
Sit, eat.

121
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,519
You haven’t eaten anything
since morning.

122
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,800
A whole day has passed.

123
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:58,270
The sun is about to set,
and he’s still not back.

124
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:06,600
What if something happened to him?
What if he was attacked by robbers?

125
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,720
There are always many robbers in the forest!
Or what if he was bitten by a snake?

126
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
No!

127
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,080
It was a scorpion.

128
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,000
There are always many poisonous
scorpions in the forest.

129
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:20,750
And now my Ajamila

130
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,962
lying in the grass,
dying from its venom.

131
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,799
I will go look for him!

132
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,328
Well, say something to me.

133
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:33,448
What?

134
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,168
Well, make something up.

135
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,602
You are so vocal,
after all.

136
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:42,010
Sorry, dear, I have to go.

137
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,651
Won’t you say a word?

138
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,744
Why should I?

139
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,030
I want to hear about
your passion one more time.

140
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
You’ll hear it.

141
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,250
Later.

142
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,389
But I want it now.

143
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,010
Later. I’m in a hurry.

144
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,115
Well, tell me I’m a goddess.

145
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,589
Well, goddess.

146
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,010
Not like that! Say it
the way you did before!

147
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,205
Like this: “My Goddess”!

148
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,835
I didn’t say that.

149
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,441
What?

150
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:22,321
Like this “My Goddess”.
I never said that.

151
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:25,146
I didn’t say it like that!

152
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:28,480
Didn’t say it?
Ah, you rascal!

153
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,459
Get away from me.

154
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,800
Calm down!
Everything’s fine.

155
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,736
Nothing happened.

156
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,539
Not fine!
You’re cold-hearted!

157
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,270
A stone, that’s who you are!

158
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,392
Can’t even be nice to me.

159
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,130
Yes, I can be nice…
But later.

160
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,177
Then we’ll talk later.

161
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:55,740
So, in a week?..
My goddess?

162
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,600
Go already.

163
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,447
Bye then.

164
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,970
No daughter, you’re not going
to the forest alone. Sit down!

165
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,730
How can I just sit
and do nothing?

166
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,171
I cannot live without him.

167
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:18,086
I will pray.
I hope he returns soon.

168
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,980
Ah, daughter, daughter.

169
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:30,740
My heart hurts like
never before.

170
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:35,250
Something terrible has happened to him.
Father, I feel something terrible.

171
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,889
You are… so beautiful…
like a flower…

172
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:46,821
Flower?.. Everyone
tells me I’m a goddess!

173
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,120
Are you talking about that man?..
Who is he to you?

174
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,310
Man? So, you saw him, Ajamila?

175
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,837
I did.

176
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:06,315
And now what?

177
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,066
I don’t know.

178
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:16,626
But I know. Shall I tell?

179
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,983
Come close to me.
I’ll whisper it in your ear.

180
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
You probably also
want to be with me here,

181
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,326
in the forest,
where no one sees us?..

182
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,303
You probably also
want me to love you?

183
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:51,630
You know, I’m ready.

184
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,950
Because I like you.

185
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,283
Do you hear me?
I’m ready, Ajamila. I’m ready.

186
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,220
I will be very happy
if you wear this.

187
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,155
Is that for me?

188
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,145
How lovely!

189
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:20,145
Thank you.

190
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:27,378
Why are you silent?
Do you hear me?

191
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,910
No… No!

192
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,699
Well, ok then, no.

193
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:39,699
Run home.

194
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:49,209
And if you change your mind
and want to find me, you will.

195
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,880
only…

196
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,540
What?

197
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,209
Money

198
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,879
what?

199
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,030
Money. Coins.
My love costs something.

200
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:12,537
And if you don’t have any,
nevermind, Brahman Ajamila.

201
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:30,740
God! God! Is this a dream? No!

202
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,799
Did this happen to me?

203
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:37,119
I have my wife Kamali!
Father… My path!

204
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,166
What’s happening to me?

205
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:20,295
Ajamila?! Where have you been?
I almost died…

206
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,960
Ajamila. What’s wrong with you?
What happened?

207
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,874
Nothing happened.

208
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,620
Where were you?

209
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,679
Collecting wood, flowers.

210
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,240
Why did it take so long?

211
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,260
Long? No, I was quick.

212
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,280
Still, Ajamila, why so long?

213
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:46,000
Nothing happened!
It just turned out that way.

214
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,037
Nothing happened!

215
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:52,818
Everything is fine with me!
Fine! All good!

216
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:02,004
Ajamila!

217
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:03,956
Brahman Ajamila!

218
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,851
I know you have money!

219
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:11,601
There! Give it to me,
and you’ll get something in return…

220
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,942
I’m ready, Ajamila. Ready.

221
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:08,400
Come to me! Forget everyone.

222
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Now you have only me
in your life!

223
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,579
I will give you what
you’ve never experienced.

224
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,779
Just come to me…

225
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,985
Why didn’t we meet earlier?
We are made for each other.

226
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:32,586
Didn’t you realize that
after our meeting?

227
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:36,586
I am your fate.
I am your real life…

228
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:38,948
My embrace is gentler
than your wife’s.

229
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:42,852
Right, Ajamila?
Don’t deceive yourself.

230
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:46,618
I am much more skilled
in love than she is.

231
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:51,000
And how sweet my lips are!
What are you waiting for?

232
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,154
Taste them!

233
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,177
Prabhu, are you awake?

234
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:55,567
Why aren’t you getting up?
Are you waiting for me?

235
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,957
Yes.

236
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,437
Kamali, get up, we need
to perform the ritual today.

237
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,183
We need to prepare.

238
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:08,563
Yes, we do!

239
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,689
You probably also
want me to love you?

240
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:50,331
You know, I’m ready.
Because I like you.

241
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,510
Do you hear me?

242
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,815
Ajamila!

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,220
Purnahuti

244
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,000
The Lord joyfully entered
your home.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,718
Let him stay here forever,

246
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:15,255
and bring prosperity
and peace with him.

247
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:17,913
I am your destiny.
I am your real life…

248
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,986
Your blessings warm my heart.

249
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:21,986
Thank you for them…

250
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:25,522
And you are a lucky man!
You have such a son — Ajamila!

251
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,913
My embrace is gentler
than your wife’s embrace.

252
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,727
Right, Ajamila?

253
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,779
Yes… Ajamila is my hope!

254
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,633
I want him to become
better than me.

255
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,950
What are you waiting for?
Taste them!

256
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,240
Ajamila!.. Ajamila!

257
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,179
Good sign, Ajamila!

258
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,652
The Lord sends us a good sign.

259
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,520
By the way!

260
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:19,242
To you and your son, with heartfelt
gratitude, Lochan Babu.

261
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,570
Money! Money… Coins…!

262
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,100
My love costs something…

263
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:35,793
…He will have beautiful
eyes like yours…

264
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:38,221
And let the chin be
like his grandfather’s.

265
00:23:38,221 --> 00:23:39,660
Okay.

266
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,362
He will have beautiful
long fingers…

267
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:45,510
And when he grows up, he will be
tall, even taller than you…

268
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:50,600
Kamali, do you really think
this is possible?

269
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,326
My mother always said,

270
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:55,278
that parents should
first imagine their child,

271
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,009
and only then give birth.

272
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,181
The Lord will definitely
give us such a son,

273
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,502
as we create in our minds.

274
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:06,252
Ajamila, it’s actually so simple!

275
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,228
Well… maybe…

276
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,839
Let’s sit down here!

277
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:16,000
Madhava, Gopala…
Narayana!

278
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,108
That’s what we will
call him, Ajamila…

279
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,000
Our son…

280
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,182
Our little boy…
Our treasure.

281
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:28,732
Narayana. It’s so affectionate.
My Narayana!

282
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,220
Have you already imagined him?

283
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,610
Of course!
I imagine him well.

284
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,081
How do you manage that?

285
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,351
What?

286
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:42,638
Well… imagining, what his eyes,
what his hands will be like.

287
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,665
What name we’ll give him.

288
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:52,783
I just close my eyes
and see all this…

289
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:14,087
Kamali, dear, let’s go home.

290
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:17,626
Home, why? We are having
such a good time walking.

291
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,808
I’m feeling unwell.

292
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:25,808
Something feels wrong…

293
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,560
Is your head hurting?

294
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,800
Prabhu, do you even hear me?

295
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,970
Huh? What? Ah…
I hear you, I hear.

296
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,762
Yes, I hear you…

297
00:25:54,509 --> 00:26:00,909
Now everything will be fine.
You will feel better soon.

298
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,860
Just rest for a bit
and you’ll feel better.

299
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:28,608
Oh Lord, what’s happening to me?

300
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,833
This has never happened before.

301
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,440
Why can’t I get her
out of my head?

302
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,708
I don’t want this!
Where is my mind?

303
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:38,951
Where is my piety?
What am I doing?

304
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,390
It’s not too late to stop!

305
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:45,470
My wife, my Kamali,
I can’t treat her like this.

306
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:49,413
You probably also want
to be with me here in the forest,

307
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:53,500
where no one sees us?
Because I like you…

308
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:59,000
…And if you want
to find me, you will….

309
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,270
…My love costs something….

310
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:54,400
Forgive me. I can’t.
Her hands, voice… I can’t…

311
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,936
Well, you know, if you have money
— come in, but if not…

312
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Not today, but I'll have it
tomorrow… You know that.

313
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:52,484
When you have it,
then you can come…

314
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,842
You can’t treat me like this,

315
00:28:56,842 --> 00:29:00,220
I won’t leave you today,
I’ve left everything to come to you.

316
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:02,080
Let me go! It hurts!

317
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,354
"Let her go".
Stop acting innocent!

318
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,930
Let her go!

319
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,130
Who are you?

320
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,590
Well, come in since you’ve come.
I’ve been waiting!

321
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,169
Now I understand why
you didn’t want to let me in!

322
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,759
You were waiting for this…
Brahman…

323
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,554
And what about you?

324
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:36,974
Me? Oh, I will leave
and never come back again.

325
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:40,450
And you… very soon

326
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,100
…will turn into…

327
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,750
Well?

328
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,040
Into an old woman
who no one needs!

329
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:50,660
Be happy, Brahman.

330
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:55,789
We’ll meet again.

331
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:15,480
Well, hello, Brahman Ajamila.

332
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Hello… uh…

333
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,940
Varsha.
That’s my name.

334
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,750
Hello, Varsha.

335
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,630
I thought Brahmans
sleep at this time.

336
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,309
But look, Brahmans are
fully awake and wandering.

337
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:29,700
So…

338
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,505
You’re not in a hurry?

339
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:39,679
Well then, I am not
in a hurry either. Let’s go…

340
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:13,191
Ajamila…

341
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,691
Well, come to me…

342
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,377
Ajamila!

343
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:41,609
Yes, Gurudev…

344
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,121
Once long ago, I asked you…

345
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:48,944
Are you ready to follow the principles
of religion to the end of your life

346
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:51,405
…What did you answer me then?

347
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:54,040
That I am ready, Gurudev…

348
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,510
Ajamila…

349
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:43,145
Ajamila, is that it?

350
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:44,645
What do you want?

351
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:47,530
You were gone for almost a day,

352
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,250
you come and just go to sleep?

353
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,549
Did you want to
tell me anything?

354
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:59,254
No way, Ajamila.
You will explain everything to me.

355
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,571
Where have you been?

356
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:04,982
Why did you make
me and your wife worry?

357
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,696
And where is the money
that was donated to us?

358
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,167
It was my money!

359
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,070
I earned it!
And now forget it!

360
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,704
There’s no more money.

361
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,640
How dare you raise
your voice at me?

362
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:21,029
Leave me alone!

363
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:35,342
Let’s go, daughter…

364
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,560
Let it be…

365
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:54,318
Where were you? And where is
the money that was donated to us?

366
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,909
It was my money, I earned it,

367
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,024
forget about it, there’s
no more money! Leave me alone!

368
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:03,261
Father!

369
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:07,060
You left early in the morning,
and now look — it’s noon.

370
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,410
Only a little time has passed…

371
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,770
I wanted to sleep, but I couldn’t.
They didn’t let me…

372
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,910
Who didn’t let you?

373
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,531
Well, father and wife.

374
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,360
Whose wife?

375
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,133
Mine.

376
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:26,883
So you’re married?

377
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,293
Yes, but it’s nothing serious.

378
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:38,047
Well, if it’s not serious for you,
it’s even less so for me.

379
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:05,148
So, you have a family…
Good…

380
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:07,010
And what did you tell them?

381
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,530
What could I tell them?

382
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,050
Do you not care?

383
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,311
…not really.

384
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:21,139
Though now it’s easier.

385
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,968
Just three days ago,
it was very hard for me.

386
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,895
But then something changed.

387
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:27,480
Something inside me burned out.

388
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:31,382
I no longer want to think
and weigh every step.

389
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,626
And to be afraid of
what others will say.

390
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,529
I’ve done that my whole life.

391
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:40,634
I want to breathe freely,
to live without fear and remorse.

392
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:45,400
After that meeting with you,
there, in the forest…

393
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:49,990
I couldn’t think of
anything else but you.

394
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,720
Neither my family nor my duties,

395
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,229
nothing could make me
forget you.

396
00:37:56,229 --> 00:38:01,530
your hands, your voice,
your eyes.

397
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,881
I don’t want to play the role of
a faithful husband and loving son,

398
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,975
when here is a burning
fire inside me.

399
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:09,560
I can’t, and I don’t want to.

400
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,526
I just want to be with you,

401
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,760
only with you.

402
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:19,419
So what… have you
fallen in love with me?

403
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:20,716
Yes…

404
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,750
Have you really found
something special in me?

405
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,994
Oh! You don’t even know
how wonderful you are!

406
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:28,369
You are my perfection.

407
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:30,869
You are life itself to me!

408
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,381
I just can’t live without you!

409
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,020
I want to be only with you…
only with you…

410
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:45,208
Where is he?

411
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:47,699
I just saw Ajamila…

412
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:52,060
He went into the house
of a well-known prostitute.

413
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:54,632
I thought so.

414
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,375
Will you go get him?

415
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:03,746
No. He couldn’t be
kept by a young wife,

416
00:39:03,746 --> 00:39:07,680
nor by the path of religion
he has followed for so long.

417
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,660
If he has made his choice,
what can I do?

418
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,390
It’s all my fault.

419
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:21,591
I invested everything I had
in Ajamila.

420
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,430
But he made his own choice.

421
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,000
In an instant, the Lord
rid me of my pride,

422
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,020
my hopes, my expectations…

423
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:43,060
My good name…

424
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,200
All I can do now is pray
that the Lord doesn’t leave him.

425
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:19,204
So what should we do?

426
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,589
What do you mean?

427
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:24,356
You’ve been living with me
for several days now…

428
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,119
Your money has long run out.

429
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,520
And you don’t have
any new money.

430
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:34,837
And all my… admirers…
You chased them away…

431
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:41,422
If you’re worried about money,
that’s not a problem for me.

432
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:46,721
Really? That’s good news.

433
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:52,699
Yes. It was never
a problem for me.

434
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,415
And where will we live?

435
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,175
Live?..

436
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,870
We can live at my place.

437
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,830
I will bring you to my house.

438
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,373
You’ll have a separate room.

439
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,180
If you agree to be with me —
I’ll provide for you.

440
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:27,331
Tell me, do Brahmans chant
something every day?

441
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:29,840
You have some mantras,
don’t you?

442
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,030
Three times a day…

443
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,300
A hymn to praise the Sun God…

444
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,000
Three times a day! When was
the last time you chanted them?

445
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:49,539
Well, probably last week.
That was the last time.

446
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:55,795
And then you found love?

447
00:41:58,561 --> 00:42:02,168
Oh come on,
I really do love you.

448
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:08,160
Love… I believe… You don’t
give up everything like that…

449
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,118
And I don’t…

450
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:11,440
Okay, okay. I understand…

451
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,210
Tell your family that
I am… a maid.

452
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,595
If they believe it,
of course.

453
00:42:18,595 --> 00:42:21,470
Tell your wife…

454
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,150
Although…
Say whatever you want…

455
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:28,619
But remember,
I won’t work for you.

456
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,906
You will be the one
bringing money to me…

457
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:35,270
For my love… Got it?

458
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:41,650
We still have time left…
How shall we spend it?

459
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:47,691
Come up to me,
I’ll whisper it in your ear.

460
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:51,633
You know how much
I adore you…

461
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:37,431
Ajamila… You came!
You're back!

462
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:40,242
Is this your wife?

463
00:43:40,717 --> 00:43:44,957
Prabhu… Who is this woman?

464
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,990
Kamali, meet Varsha.

465
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:51,650
Why has she come
to our house?

466
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,853
She will help you
with the household.

467
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,090
Prabhu, am I not
managing by myself?

468
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:15,124
So what,
am I going to live here?

469
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:20,466
Yes…

470
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,880
And… She…
Where will she live?

471
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,030
There…

472
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,362
Ajamila, I need a bed here.

473
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:36,010
I need shelves for my clothes
and jewelry boxes.

474
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,887
You will buy me jewelry,
won’t you?

475
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,850
I remember, you promised…

476
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:45,825
And tell her
not to hover over me.

477
00:44:45,825 --> 00:44:50,065
This is now my home too.
And we will live here together.

478
00:44:53,888 --> 00:44:55,961
Wait… Where are you going?

479
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,284
Now, every time she wants to cry,

480
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:01,303
you’ll run to comfort her?

481
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,859
Do you think that’s normal?

482
00:45:04,152 --> 00:45:06,162
She is my wife!

483
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,855
And so?
I need attention too.

484
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:13,613
You don’t want
to get me upset, do you?

485
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:17,077
Okay.

486
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:27,662
I want to spend tonight
in the yard.

487
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:34,291
I can no longer and do not want to
stay in this house.

488
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,600
Bring a bed out for me.

489
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:45,014
Ajamila, come to your father.

490
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,290
What is it, father?

491
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:58,003
My time has come, there is no one else
for me to think about but the Lord.

492
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,770
And I won’t stay here anymore.

493
00:46:02,965 --> 00:46:08,865
I will leave… I hope
it will be easier for you.

494
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,683
Let’s go, daughter…

495
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,800
Ajamila, it’s getting dark.
It’s time for us to go to bed.

496
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:39,171
And you know — I need
all your attention and care.

497
00:46:41,476 --> 00:46:47,237
Alright. Ajamila,
I am waiting for you…

498
00:46:48,335 --> 00:46:49,717
I am waiting for you…

499
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,971
Father… Father… why?

500
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:09,551
It hurts!
It hurts so much!

501
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:38,221
The stars are
so beautiful tonight!

502
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,695
They have always been like this,
as long as I can remember.

503
00:47:46,055 --> 00:47:50,000
I look at them every day.

504
00:47:51,627 --> 00:47:55,300
My days are not like one another,

505
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,930
but the stars
always remain the same.

506
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:09,108
Oh Supreme Lord,
master of my life,

507
00:48:09,108 --> 00:48:14,200
You are unchanging,
like the stars in the sky.

508
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,279
And unchanging is
Your love for us.

509
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:25,410
Yet we, blinded by
our own pain,

510
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:31,949
cannot see Your love
in our lives…

511
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:38,646
Oh my Narayana,
oh Merciful One,

512
00:48:39,134 --> 00:48:42,042
I ask You,

513
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:46,869
help me to open my heart

514
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:52,039
enter into it…
I am waiting for You…

515
00:48:54,716 --> 00:48:58,310
Who is there?

516
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:04,887
My Lord, is it You?

517
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:11,411
I see You…
I recognize You!

518
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:16,754
How beautiful You are…

519
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:22,748
You have come for me…

520
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:36,766
You Yourself have come for me!
I am ready to go.

521
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:58,775
Father! Father! Father!

522
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,775
Father! Father! Father!

523
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:25,131
Your father died last night.

524
00:50:29,034 --> 00:50:30,974
Father!

525
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:36,278
I pray to the Almighty give you
spiritual wisdom and strength

526
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:39,677
to never stray from the path of
righteousness and virtue.

527
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,632
Do not leave me,
I need your strength.

528
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,458
My blessings
will never leave you, son,

529
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:53,040
you can always count on me.

530
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,770
And you will come to see me
in the ashram, won’t you?

531
00:50:55,770 --> 00:51:00,400
Of course, son… We will
see each other constantly.

532
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,695
That’s good, that’s so good!

533
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:13,215
Father!
What have I done?

534
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:17,685
…what have I done…

535
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,661
Not only your father
died tonight…

536
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,292
Tonight, your wife also died.

537
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:28,986
What? What are you saying,
Kamali?..

538
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:34,416
The Kamali who once
married Ajamila,

539
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:37,280
a man of duty and honor,
no longer exists.

540
00:51:38,754 --> 00:51:42,054
I can no longer stay here…

541
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:44,273
I want to leave.

542
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:51,101
Are you letting me go?

543
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:09,440
I let you go…
Kamali…

544
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:15,548
Thank you, Prabhu.
Please forgive me.

545
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:22,567
I couldn’t be
the wife you deserved.

546
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:25,772
No… You were…

547
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:35,367
Kamali… Kamali…

548
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:41,790
Forgive me if you can.

549
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:12,124
We’ve run out of money.

550
00:54:13,638 --> 00:54:17,114
I know, you’ve told me already.

551
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,639
And I need some more clothes.

552
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:30,425
Yesterday, I received a piece of fabric,
a pot of oil, and five silver coins.

553
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,708
What can we give
to the temple from this?

554
00:54:33,726 --> 00:54:35,326
I think three coins.

555
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:41,691
Take these coins and give them
to the head pujari.

556
00:54:41,738 --> 00:54:42,878
Yes, father.

557
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:48,550
Daughter, can we manage with two coins
and a pot of oil for a week?

558
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,902
Of course, father.

559
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:55,920
What shall we do?

560
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:03,734
I don’t know, I’ll go
and figure it out.

561
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:06,109
Figure it out?

562
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:09,314
Maybe it’s better
I figure it out.

563
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:12,843
Maybe I should invite
someone over?

564
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:14,625
What?

565
00:55:16,656 --> 00:55:20,233
Forget about that! I'll take care
of everything! No guests!

566
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:25,170
I’ll provide for you!
And forget about your old profession!

567
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:12,592
Do you think this junk
is worth anything?

568
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,683
Probably not.

569
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:21,772
Then why do you have it?

570
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,508
I’ll try to exchange it
for some rice.

571
00:56:24,508 --> 00:56:26,793
Some rice…

572
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:34,705
Tell me, dear, do you plan to
feed me anything besides rice?

573
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:44,035
I would love some fresh fish…

574
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:47,781
Varsha, I’ve told you
so many times!

575
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:51,981
Varsha, Varsha.
If you don’t want fish, fine.

576
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:53,931
But I do.

577
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:59,675
Fried… a bit spicy…
mmm, it’s so delicious…

578
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:07,034
Here’s what I’ll tell you,
Ajamila.

579
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:09,453
A month is a long time.

580
00:57:09,453 --> 00:57:11,942
Somehow we managed it.

581
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,727
And I am going
to keep living.

582
00:57:15,467 --> 00:57:17,094
But I am going to live…

583
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,057
not like this.

584
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:22,354
What do you mean?

585
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:27,213
When I was alone,
I only relied on myself.

586
00:57:28,102 --> 00:57:32,998
But now I have you.
So, please, provide for me.

587
00:57:34,267 --> 00:57:36,783
Especially since…

588
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:40,906
I’ll have to eat more soon.

589
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:44,540
Why? Are you planning
to gain weight?

590
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,713
No, but I must…

591
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,980
Why are you
looking at me like that?

592
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:56,398
We’re going to have a child.
A little Ajamila.

593
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:05,729
Kamali, my girl, you’ve been living
with us for a year now

594
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:09,012
Do you ever feel hungry
or in need?

595
00:58:09,012 --> 00:58:10,450
Of course not, father.

596
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,284
I’m completely satisfied
with my life.

597
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,974
I don’t need money.

598
00:58:13,974 --> 00:58:16,500
I love you both
with all my heart

599
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,157
You are my treasure

600
00:58:19,273 --> 00:58:20,406
but…

601
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:22,933
But what?

602
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:26,017
Well this righteous
Brahman Ajamila…

603
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:28,209
simply won't
give me a son.

604
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,264
Did you hear that,
righteous Brahman?

605
00:58:32,264 --> 00:58:34,029
Alright, alright, father!

606
00:58:34,029 --> 00:58:36,870
I’ll give you grandchildren.
Lots of them.

607
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:38,820
Well, say something?

608
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,666
You don’t know where
babies come from?

609
00:58:41,848 --> 00:58:44,848
Or do you think you
didn’t take part in this?

610
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:49,867
No, just…

611
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:53,905
I’m happy Varsha,
very happy… Very happy.

612
00:58:55,556 --> 00:58:57,285
I have always wanted a son.

613
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:59,968
Really? Are you
telling me the truth?

614
00:59:00,192 --> 00:59:02,636
You always wanted a son?

615
00:59:03,343 --> 00:59:07,318
I promise, you will have a son
when the time comes. Just…

616
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:13,532
Only rice won’t be enough.
Do you understand, Ajamila?

617
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:32,700
Look what I have…
Please, buy them …

618
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:40,881
It’s for puja.
Maybe you’ll buy it? No…

619
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:45,577
Look, it’s very cheap…

620
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:51,545
Good paraphernalia.
Almost new… Would you like to buy?

621
00:59:57,414 --> 00:59:59,803
Dear sir!

622
01:00:00,983 --> 01:00:04,669
I want to offer you
a very valuable item.

623
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,997
Well, if you don’t want it,
nevermind. I’ll go.

624
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:19,130
Wait… Ajamila, is that you?!

625
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:23,294
I haven’t seen you in a while

626
01:00:23,326 --> 01:00:27,197
but I heard about
your wife, father…

627
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,409
but I understand…

628
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,502
You don’t understand…

629
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:34,875
No one understands me!

630
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:36,921
When I was good
in people’s eyes,

631
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:39,460
everyone greeted me,
everyone was happy to see me.

632
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,760
Hello, Ajamila!
Will you perform a ritual for us?

633
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,472
But when I started living
the way I want, what happened?

634
01:00:45,472 --> 01:00:48,772
Everyone stopped even looking
at me! Afraid of sin!

635
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,058
Yes, I am living with
the woman I love,

636
01:00:52,058 --> 01:00:54,160
and want to be happy with her!

637
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,160
So what? Universal hatred?

638
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,984
Everyone wanted the right Ajamila,

639
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:02,001
but I want to be myself!

640
01:01:02,156 --> 01:01:05,156
Can I do anything
for you, Ajamila?

641
01:01:08,088 --> 01:01:10,603
Buy this from me.

642
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,443
You have no money?

643
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,011
Please just buy it.
I’ll buy food for my family.

644
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:21,362
That’s why I came here.

645
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:27,503
Please take it.

646
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:34,404
Thank you.

647
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:12,742
There!

648
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:24,374
Fish… So much… Why?

649
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:27,435
Why? You asked for fish!

650
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:32,511
Fry some fish for yourself,
Varsha. And for me…

651
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:36,203
Did I hear that right?

652
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:38,548
You heard right.

653
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:46,030
You’re changing, Ajamila.

654
01:02:54,652 --> 01:02:57,652
You never used to eat fish…
What happened?

655
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:02,388
There is new Ajamila.

656
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,830
The old one is gone.

657
01:03:12,573 --> 01:03:15,573
So, how was your day?
Successful?

658
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:35,099
Although, you don’t have to say,
your face says it all.

659
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:42,597
Was today successful?

660
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:46,579
Absolutely!

661
01:03:56,122 --> 01:03:59,122
Dear sir,
are you playing fair?

662
01:03:59,727 --> 01:04:01,822
You want to insult me,
esteemed one?

663
01:04:02,029 --> 01:04:04,321
Honesty is my middle name!

664
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:06,768
Well then, let’s play.

665
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,120
Now we’re talking!
And do you have money?

666
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:13,182
Of course, I do.

667
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:17,916
Dice don’t like playing for nothing!
Dice need respect!

668
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:22,195
So, shall we play?

669
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,157
I won!

670
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:46,704
Alright! You’re lucky today.
Move aside, let another try.

671
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:50,467
I want to play too!
I’ll bet one coin!

672
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,300
Alright, let’s do it.

673
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:05,681
He won! He won!

674
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:08,681
Well done!

675
01:05:09,002 --> 01:05:12,002
Brother, you’re lucky today.

676
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,711
One more time.

677
01:05:22,556 --> 01:05:25,556
If only luck would
come my way!

678
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:39,534
Maybe I should play too?
Maybe I’ll get lucky?

679
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:46,082
Ah, shame I didn’t bring money.
I would play too!

680
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:51,688
Well, well, well…
What did he roll?

681
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:56,427
Ah, he lost.
I knew it, he’s a loser.

682
01:05:56,763 --> 01:05:59,355
Tough luck for you!

683
01:05:59,447 --> 01:06:02,447
It’s alright, honorable one,
next time you’ll get luck.

684
01:06:02,614 --> 01:06:05,614
Let’s get out of here,
why stand, staring? Let’s go.

685
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,171
Come on, hang in there.

686
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:15,917
Money and greed —
a beautiful combination,

687
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:19,247
when you know how to use them.

688
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:23,502
How’s our baby?

689
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:26,146
He’s moving non-stop.

690
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,831
Married to a Brahmin.
Who would imagine?

691
01:07:44,948 --> 01:07:47,481
Good day, pilgrims.

692
01:07:47,629 --> 01:07:49,849
Peace be upon you, good sir.

693
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:52,849
Where are you heading?

694
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:57,419
We’re visiting holy places.
Heading to blessed Prayag now.

695
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:03,015
Our pilgrimage has come to an end.

696
01:08:03,015 --> 01:08:08,747
We're going to rest today, take a bath,
and tomorrow we will…

697
01:08:08,747 --> 01:08:11,723
…perform auspicious rituals
and feed the Brahmins.

698
01:08:11,723 --> 01:08:15,723
Right! To mark the end
of our journey!

699
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,887
As the sacred texts say.

700
01:08:21,984 --> 01:08:28,012
Why are you, a healthy man, leading
the blind and giving them your time?

701
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:30,609
You’re like in prison with them!

702
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:32,369
You’re not your own master.

703
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:35,219
Walking with them,
caring for them.

704
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,923
You can’t leave them
even for a minute.

705
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:40,129
What else is human life for?

706
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:43,000
If not to help others
and serve the Lord

707
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,024
how else should we
spend our time?

708
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:49,328
Time should be spent wisely.
Not wandering aimlessly.

709
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:52,322
These people are my destiny.

710
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:55,293
Together, we visit holy places
and pray to the Lord.

711
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:58,890
Dad, you’re a Brahmin yourself,

712
01:08:58,992 --> 01:09:01,318
are you going to make
gifts to yourself?

713
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,223
Even though we’re Brahmins,
we too must engage in charity

714
01:09:06,888 --> 01:09:11,979
and use all money for
serving the Lord and holy people.

715
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:17,066
Now let’s check your bags,

716
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:20,501
shake your clothes a little.

717
01:09:21,163 --> 01:09:23,375
Maybe a coin will jingle!

718
01:09:23,552 --> 01:09:26,653
No! Leave these people in peace!
We won’t touch anyone!

719
01:09:26,797 --> 01:09:29,797
What? If you can’t do it
yourself, don’t stop us.

720
01:09:31,394 --> 01:09:34,394
Look at that brahmin…

721
01:09:40,401 --> 01:09:46,211
So, so… aha… what’s this?
Come on, let’s see…

722
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:50,993
Come on, show me,
what’s in your bag?

723
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:57,351
Maybe hiding something
in your turban? Come on, show it!

724
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:59,622
Aha, what about you?

725
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:05,179
You too, turn around.

726
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,199
Look at this, said
they were poor pilgrims!

727
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:13,390
Look, I found a coin too.

728
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,899
Look at that, not bad…

729
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:23,873
Here you go…
Alright, go now…

730
01:10:41,448 --> 01:10:44,292
Ajamila, what in the world?

731
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:47,946
In our profession,
your cowardice can cost a life.

732
01:10:48,362 --> 01:10:51,362
Either you’re with us
or you can go to hell.

733
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:55,811
So?

734
01:10:59,224 --> 01:11:00,754
Okay…

735
01:11:00,942 --> 01:11:02,534
Okay what?

736
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:05,941
I’m with you…

737
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:14,941
I’m with you.

738
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,152
That’s good, Ajamila.
But remember…

739
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:21,451
There won’t be a second time.

740
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:39,262
Brahman

741
01:11:41,098 --> 01:11:42,642
Who are you?

742
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:45,601
Om Tat Sat

743
01:11:46,491 --> 01:11:49,491
Swaha. Purnahuti.

744
01:11:55,919 --> 01:12:00,544
Leave them! Empty…

745
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,918
Om Tat Sat

746
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:09,872
Om Tat Sat

747
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:16,770
Let’s go to Prayag!

748
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:23,507
Of course, on foot

749
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:28,061
God is with us

750
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:34,107
Used to be a Brahman, now robber…

751
01:12:34,265 --> 01:12:38,525
with a knife. And they’re pilgrims…

752
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:43,186
Be damned, Brahman Ajamila!

753
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:46,783
Be damned!

754
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,066
Who invented that wine?

755
01:13:33,232 --> 01:13:37,340
It’s tough with it,
and tough without it.

756
01:13:38,088 --> 01:13:41,088
What, can’t get yesterday’s
blind men out of your head?

757
01:13:44,998 --> 01:13:47,791
It was hard for me at first too.

758
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:51,820
They’re holy pilgrims,
and we rob them.

759
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,746
And then?

760
01:13:54,307 --> 01:13:57,307
Then I got used to it,
it became easier.

761
01:13:57,671 --> 01:14:01,324
It’s my job,
and their fate.

762
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:05,911
The past doesn’t let go easily.

763
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,445
It will.

764
01:14:10,441 --> 01:14:13,441
Yeah, the sooner the better.

765
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,840
Give me the money!

766
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:34,623
Do you hear me? Or I’ll finish off
your whole miserable family!

767
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:36,905
Where’s the money, I said!

768
01:15:06,986 --> 01:15:08,912
This is for you.

769
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,625
Where did you get them?

770
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:39,722
Doesn’t matter.
It’s for you.

771
01:15:41,726 --> 01:15:44,324
I know you didn’t buy these.

772
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:47,125
But you know I can’t
wear this on the street.

773
01:15:47,201 --> 01:15:49,604
Someone will surely
recognize their jewelry.

774
01:15:51,695 --> 01:15:54,695
Then why did you bring it?

775
01:15:56,452 --> 01:16:00,095
Listen, your occupation
becomes very dangerous.

776
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:04,510
The town is buzzing with talk
about robbers in the forest.

777
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,233
The king has already sent
a squad of his best warriors,

778
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:10,655
to catch the robbers
and bring them to trial.

779
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:13,963
And the king has already come up
with most terrible punishment…

780
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:15,191
What is that?

781
01:16:15,448 --> 01:16:18,572
The king ordered the robbers to
have their hands and feet severed.

782
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:21,572
But spare their lives
as a warning to others.

783
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:34,141
So better get rid of this…
Give it to jewelers to melt it down.

784
01:19:47,508 --> 01:19:50,508
Kamali… is that you?

785
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:07,609
Kamali… how… why…

786
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:11,419
Sir, you’re mistaken.
That woman is dead.

787
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:14,206
I’m just a simple beggar.

788
01:20:15,538 --> 01:20:17,776
Sir, we’re just beggars.

789
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,314
Keep going your way.
This is not a place for you.

790
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:46,719
Ajamila, Kamali’s fate
is on your hands…

791
01:20:46,937 --> 01:20:49,937
Don’t forget that.

792
01:20:50,887 --> 01:20:54,514
Sir, you’re mistaken.
That woman is dead.

793
01:21:39,347 --> 01:21:40,908
Hello Varsha.

794
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,205
I see… brought the debt?

795
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:47,094
Yes, of course!

796
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:56,333
Good! What else?

797
01:21:56,376 --> 01:21:57,624
I missed you.

798
01:21:58,545 --> 01:22:02,369
Missed me? Maybe also say
you’re crazy about me,

799
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:04,648
And that you can’t live
without me?

800
01:22:04,808 --> 01:22:05,515
Exactly.

801
01:22:08,508 --> 01:22:11,508
So maybe you’ll even
marry me, huh?

802
01:22:28,665 --> 01:22:31,665
Maybe you’ll let
an old friend inside?

803
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:41,510
What if Ajamila comes?

804
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:43,405
He won’t come.

805
01:22:45,101 --> 01:22:47,307
But what if he does?

806
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:49,794
He won’t come.

807
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:09,959
Father, look how beautiful
it is here!

808
01:23:12,919 --> 01:23:15,645
What… what are you doing?

809
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,740
Wait! Wait! I’ll give you
all the money!

810
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,870
Son, my boy…

811
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:26,399
He’s dead.
You killed him.

812
01:23:27,157 --> 01:23:28,271
What makes you say that?

813
01:23:29,444 --> 01:23:33,241
Hey! Get up! Wake up!

814
01:23:33,962 --> 01:23:36,962
Wake up, open your eyes…

815
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:43,778
…I didn’t mean to…

816
01:23:44,374 --> 01:23:45,762
didn’t mean to…

817
01:23:46,441 --> 01:23:49,441
no… no… not this…

818
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:55,100
His wife and children are waiting…
Do you have children?

819
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:04,126
Dad, are you leaving already?

820
01:24:05,334 --> 01:24:06,883
Will you bring gifts?

821
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:15,556
Will you take this money
to your family?

822
01:24:15,874 --> 01:24:19,000
Don’t preach to me about morals!

823
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,983
I know everything myself!
I didn’t mean to kill! I didn’t want to!

824
01:24:22,068 --> 01:24:25,855
I only need money!
Nothing else! Just the money!

825
01:24:26,697 --> 01:24:31,968
I don’t need your miserable lives!
I don’t need anything! Nothing!

826
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,654
Will you take this money to your family?
Do you think they’ll be happier?

827
01:24:39,782 --> 01:24:44,312
You want to make someone happy,
by killing and bringing grief to others?

828
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:58,395
Well, I’m leaving.
I have to go.

829
01:25:02,777 --> 01:25:05,777
Yes, of course.

830
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,631
Here, take this.

831
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,560
I think we’ll have
another son.

832
01:26:39,902 --> 01:26:43,600
What, Ajamila? We already
have so many sons.

833
01:26:44,356 --> 01:26:46,927
I want us to have a daughter.

834
01:26:47,254 --> 01:26:50,254
And we’ll name her…
Kumari.

835
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:54,728
In honor of
Lord Mahadeva’s wife.

836
01:26:59,911 --> 01:27:02,122
Prabhu, I respect the sages,

837
01:27:02,192 --> 01:27:05,440
but I’d really love our son
to have the name of the Lord

838
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:05,997
but…

839
01:27:05,997 --> 01:27:08,997
No, Don’t argue.
The name of God.

840
01:27:09,636 --> 01:27:11,594
Please. Don’t argue.

841
01:27:12,132 --> 01:27:15,132
Alright, alright.

842
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:27,579
Madhava… Gopala…
Narayana!

843
01:27:28,605 --> 01:27:29,475
What Narayana?

844
01:27:29,482 --> 01:27:32,482
That will be his name, Ajamila.
Our son.

845
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:36,049
Our little boy…
Our treasure.

846
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,722
Narayana.

847
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:41,187
No.

848
01:27:41,487 --> 01:27:46,106
Our son’s name will be Narayana.
That will bring us luck.

849
01:27:47,248 --> 01:27:51,627
Ajamila, if you want
to philosophize, go outside.

850
01:27:51,963 --> 01:27:54,032
I am going to sleep.

851
01:28:07,937 --> 01:28:10,937
Dad! Dad! You’re back!

852
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:14,991
I love you my boy!

853
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:17,454
I love you too, dad.

854
01:28:18,077 --> 01:28:19,434
Where are your brothers?

855
01:28:19,779 --> 01:28:20,995
They went to the river.

856
01:28:21,748 --> 01:28:23,037
Why didn’t you go with them?

857
01:28:23,037 --> 01:28:26,037
It’s boring with them.
I was waiting for you, dad.

858
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:48,727
Dad, catch!

859
01:28:54,675 --> 01:29:00,003
Dad, come on throw it…
Dad, seriously.

860
01:29:03,764 --> 01:29:06,389
Dad, that’s not fair!

861
01:29:06,643 --> 01:29:09,643
Always be on guard!
Then you can win!

862
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:44,405
Why are you so sad, dad?

863
01:29:45,357 --> 01:29:48,357
Nothing… all fine.

864
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:52,245
I’ll go…
take some rest.

865
01:30:07,536 --> 01:30:15,735
Ajamila, why did you do that…
You killed me, Ajamila…

866
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:24,282
Be damned… Are you happy now?
Ajamila… Ajamila…

867
01:30:24,282 --> 01:30:30,979
Why did you do that?
Now you'll have a different life…

868
01:30:31,647 --> 01:30:35,232
Come with us… Ajamila….

869
01:30:35,232 --> 01:30:36,812
Don’t touch me!

870
01:30:36,812 --> 01:30:38,834
You robbed me…
You betrayed me!

871
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:43,550
Leave me alone…
I didn’t mean to kill you…

872
01:30:44,025 --> 01:30:47,025
Don’t touch… Murderer…

873
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:50,119
Stop, go away!

874
01:30:50,392 --> 01:30:55,231
I didn’t want to,
didn’t want to!

875
01:30:55,427 --> 01:31:01,879
Be damned…
Why…

876
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,238
What happened, son?

877
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:43,579
You fainted and mom said
that you had a stroke.

878
01:31:50,566 --> 01:31:55,069
Narayana, my boy!
Do not leave me.

879
01:31:56,216 --> 01:31:58,170
I’m scared!

880
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,562
I love you Narayana

881
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:07,440
I love your mom
and your brothers

882
01:32:07,918 --> 01:32:14,069
Out of love for you
I’ve done many things…

883
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,963
which is why I’m so scared now…

884
01:32:19,423 --> 01:32:23,585
Money! Where’s the money?
Give me the money!

885
01:32:23,662 --> 01:32:26,848
Or I’ll finish all your
miserable family!!

886
01:32:26,871 --> 01:32:31,017
Where is the money I ask?
I need more! Give me all the money!

887
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:59,644
Would the Lord do that for me?
Father, did you hear?

888
01:32:59,644 --> 01:33:01,470
I will not leave this path!

889
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:03,166
Never? Never!

890
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:08,031
And you will get something in return…
It’s all my fault…

891
01:33:08,031 --> 01:33:10,521
Come to me…

892
01:33:10,521 --> 01:33:13,945
Sir, you are mistaken.
That woman died.

893
01:33:13,945 --> 01:33:17,225
Go bring me rice, fish, vegetables —
I have nothing to feed the children!

894
01:33:17,256 --> 01:33:21,251
I hate you, I hate you!!
Hate you! Hate you!!

895
01:33:23,783 --> 01:33:26,390
You, it’s because of you!

896
01:33:26,566 --> 01:33:30,903
Shut up! Better remember
who came to me first.

897
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:34,108
Who told me about love,
promised something?

898
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:37,108
Brought me money,
5 silver coins.

899
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:40,218
Who searched for me all night
like a madman?

900
01:33:40,218 --> 01:33:43,218
Who brought me here?

901
01:33:44,224 --> 01:33:49,009
It was you, Ajamila, you.
So you better be quiet.

902
01:33:49,009 --> 01:33:53,459
I just helped you to fulfill
what you dreamed of.

903
01:33:58,394 --> 01:34:01,394
Dad, is everything okay?

904
01:34:03,056 --> 01:34:06,056
Too late.

905
01:34:08,369 --> 01:34:11,890
It’s too late to change anything.

906
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,720
My life is coming to an end.

907
01:34:23,652 --> 01:34:30,109
I’ve done too much
that won’t let me die in peace.

908
01:35:36,294 --> 01:35:39,294
Well, not much.

909
01:35:46,975 --> 01:35:48,757
Where are you going?

910
01:35:50,082 --> 01:35:53,082
Money won’t fall
from the sky on us.

911
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:57,949
Yes, that’s for sure.

912
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:41,644
Thief! Thief! Get out of here!
Murderer! Go away! Thief!

913
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:46,747
That’s the same godless man!
Look at this rascal!

914
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,917
Thief! Thief!
This is not a place for you!

915
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:53,510
Comes with a child and thinks
everyone will forget about what he did?

916
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:57,048
Get out! Get out of here!
Keep walking!

917
01:36:57,048 --> 01:37:00,048
This is not a place for you!

918
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:02,390
Who does he think we are?
Don’t even come near us!

919
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,390
Go, go! Get away from here!
Look what he’s thinking!

920
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:08,763
Leave! You’ve lost your decency!
This is our place!

921
01:37:08,763 --> 01:37:12,123
This is our place! Rascal!
There’s nothing for you!

922
01:37:12,431 --> 01:37:15,607
Why did they chase you away?
Why do they hate you?

923
01:37:15,607 --> 01:37:18,607
This is their place, son.
We’re not welcomed there.

924
01:37:18,617 --> 01:37:23,370
But no one can claim the road
for themselves. It is public!

925
01:37:24,223 --> 01:37:30,056
It’s okay, son. It’s okay.
I’ll sit by myself. You go.

926
01:37:35,998 --> 01:37:37,501
You go.

927
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:41,279
I can stay with you, dad.

928
01:37:41,727 --> 01:37:45,610
I won’t be bored.
I will sing. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma!

929
01:37:47,175 --> 01:37:50,175
No, son, you better go.

930
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:52,854
Come back for me
in the evening.

931
01:37:53,481 --> 01:37:56,481
I need to be alone…

932
01:37:56,916 --> 01:38:03,087
Okay, dad. I will go.
Wait for me, don’t get sad.

933
01:38:06,267 --> 01:38:09,267
Hello, beggar Ajamila.

934
01:38:09,743 --> 01:38:12,743
Today your new life has begun.

935
01:38:51,247 --> 01:38:54,247
Is it hard for you, Ajamila?

936
01:38:57,431 --> 01:39:01,333
You are not young anymore…
Must have seen a lot, haven’t you?

937
01:39:02,506 --> 01:39:05,506
Yes, I’ve seen a lot.

938
01:39:06,435 --> 01:39:11,218
You wanted happiness, but instead
you’re afraid to look people in the eyes.

939
01:39:12,130 --> 01:39:14,572
I know…

940
01:39:14,572 --> 01:39:16,849
You chose this life for yourself.

941
01:39:16,849 --> 01:39:19,849
…stop it!
Why are you torturing me?

942
01:39:20,258 --> 01:39:23,258
Don’t you need help?

943
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:28,159
I’m not young, I have
a heavy burden on my back.

944
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:31,809
Only death will help.

945
01:39:49,047 --> 01:39:52,047
Here we are, Ajamila!

946
01:39:52,356 --> 01:39:55,356
We’ve been waiting for you
for so long!

947
01:40:00,789 --> 01:40:03,789
Who, who are you?

948
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:09,726
Your new friends!..
Don’t be afraid of us!…

949
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,880
What do you want from me?

950
01:40:16,494 --> 01:40:20,611
Where are you going, we haven’t
properly introduced ourselves yet.

951
01:40:21,026 --> 01:40:25,721
No, no… Where… Don’t…
Where are you taking me?

952
01:40:25,805 --> 01:40:31,653
Home! To the underworld! It’s time to
appear before Yamaraja’s court!

953
01:40:31,829 --> 01:40:38,875
No… I haven’t finished yet,
I still have so much to do.

954
01:40:38,894 --> 01:40:41,894
All your work is already finished.

955
01:40:45,347 --> 01:40:48,347
I have a family,
I have a little son.

956
01:40:48,415 --> 01:40:52,404
Narayana!! Narayana!!
NARAYANA!!!

957
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:55,421
Stop!

958
01:40:55,929 --> 01:40:57,562
Who are you?

959
01:40:57,562 --> 01:41:01,725
And how dare you interfere with us,
the servants of Yamaraja?!

960
01:41:01,772 --> 01:41:03,793
God of death!

961
01:41:03,793 --> 01:41:06,570
We are the messengers of
the Supreme Lord Narayana.

962
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:10,202
Let go of this man,
he is no longer in your power.

963
01:41:10,908 --> 01:41:13,908
Let go of whom, Ajamila?

964
01:41:13,941 --> 01:41:17,245
The Earth did not know
a greater sinner than him.

965
01:41:17,635 --> 01:41:24,865
He was a Brahman, but fell for
a prostitute and became a criminal.

966
01:41:24,874 --> 01:41:30,044
The darkest, most terrifying
regions of hell await for him!

967
01:41:30,044 --> 01:41:33,044
Ajamila has already atoned
for all his sins.

968
01:41:33,245 --> 01:41:37,245
In despair, he spoke
the Holy Name of Lord Narayana!

969
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:42,283
Sins are atoned by tough
austerities and penances.

970
01:41:42,283 --> 01:41:47,562
And him saying the Holy Name
is accidental!

971
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:52,056
He was just calling his son!
Yes Yes!!

972
01:41:53,092 --> 01:41:56,092
Like fire burns dry grass to ashes,

973
01:41:56,103 --> 01:41:59,849
so is the Holy Name of the Lord —
burns away all the sinful reactions,

974
01:42:00,687 --> 01:42:03,687
even if it is said unintentionally.

975
01:42:03,953 --> 01:42:06,953
You must release this man!

976
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:11,069
Okay, you win.

977
01:42:11,197 --> 01:42:15,078
Well, buddy,
we’ll see you soon!

978
01:42:15,243 --> 01:42:18,243
We’ll come back for you.

979
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,478
Lord, Lord… I’ve done nothing
worthwile in my entire life,

980
01:42:26,946 --> 01:42:30,962
I only sinned, I only tarnished
the name of Brahmins.

981
01:42:31,734 --> 01:42:36,558
But You, You’ve sent
your great servants,

982
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:42,067
and they were able to save me
from the hands of death. You saved me.

983
01:42:42,475 --> 01:42:48,509
I promise you — this old Ajamila
will never forget you again!

984
01:42:50,044 --> 01:42:53,979
I promise to never again
return to my past life!

985
01:42:54,092 --> 01:42:57,092
Never. Never.

986
01:42:58,088 --> 01:43:01,088
You gave me another chance!

987
01:43:01,158 --> 01:43:04,158
Your Holy Name saved me.

988
01:43:04,455 --> 01:43:07,799
Your Holy Name is
infinitely merciful…

989
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:15,557
Dad, dad, wait!
The city is the other way.

990
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:19,663
I’m leaving, son. I’m leaving to
dedicate my life to the Lord.

991
01:43:19,779 --> 01:43:22,779
Lord Narayana?

992
01:43:22,934 --> 01:43:25,934
Yes, son. Lord Narayana.

993
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:29,758
Where will you go?

994
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:32,835
I lived my life in vain,
I spent so many years in sin.

995
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:37,650
Now I am leaving
for Haridwar, Narayana.

996
01:43:37,794 --> 01:43:40,387
To stay there forever.

997
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:43,465
And never, never
ever stop serving the Lord.

998
01:43:45,181 --> 01:43:49,536
I’m leaving, son.
Goodbye Narayana…

999
01:43:49,614 --> 01:43:52,614
Goodbye son…

1000
01:44:16,337 --> 01:44:18,746
Dad, dad…
