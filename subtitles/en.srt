1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,589
There seem to be
too many poor people lately!

2
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,240
What do you mean?

3
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,960
Whoever you stop, you find
nothing of value. Just pennies.

4
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,946
Hey, Ajamila…

5
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,661
You weren’t always like this…

6
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,393
Like what?

7
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:22,604
Well… involved in
what you are doing now.

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,195
Why do you ask?

9
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,619
Nothing… Just curious.

10
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:36,275
Yes, there was
a different Ajamila once…

11
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,330
A different life…
everything was different.

12
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,698
And what did you do?

13
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:52,160
I was a Brahmin…
A priest.

14
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,141
…and then he rushes to Prahlada,

15
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:00,331
shakes him by the shoulders
and screams:

16
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:03,290
“Where, where is your Vishnu?
Show Him!”

17
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,770
And Prahlada?

18
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,000
Prahlada looks him in the eye
and replies with a smile:

19
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:15,570
“Dear father, look close and
you’ll see the Lord everywhere.”

20
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,570
And then?

21
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,160
And then Hiranyakashipu screams:

22
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,500
“So, your Vishnu is in my house?”

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,342
Prahlada replies with a smile:

24
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:29,401
“Yes, father, the Lord
is always in our house.”

25
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,080
Then Hiranyakashipu
grabs his sword

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,690
and starts swinging it,
shouting:

27
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,430
“Vishnu! Vishnu!
If You’re here, come out!”

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,100
And when Hiranyakashipu
saw no one,

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,400
he rushed at Prahlada
with his sword, saying:

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,630
“If your Vishnu
doesn’t appear before me now,

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,260
I’ll cut off your head!”

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,135
And Prahlada?

33
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:55,872
Prahlada, this little boy,
tells his father:

34
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,177
“Here He is, my Lord,
right before you.”

35
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:03,080
Hiranyakashipu points
at a piller and yells:

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,778
“Is he in this pillar?”

37
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:07,500
“Yes, father,
can’t you see?”

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,830
Then Hiranyakashipu grabs
his sword and with all his might

39
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,270
strikes the pillar…

40
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,526
But you know, Ajamila,

41
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:20,462
no one heard the sound
of the broken pillar

42
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,560
Why?

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,230
Because at that moment, there was
a deafening roar of a lion,

44
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,100
…and the magnificent
Lord Vishnu appeared.

45
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,200
They fought for a long time
and then Lord Narasimhadev

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,310
grabbed Hiranyakashipu,
put him on his knees

47
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,970
and with his sharp claws,
tore him to pieces.

48
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,874
And so saved his
dear devotee Prahlada.

49
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,236
And would the Lord
do the same for me?

50
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,957
Come to me and save me
from demons?

51
00:03:55,957 --> 00:04:01,015
Of course, Ajamila.
The Lord’s love is unchanging.

52
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:05,160
Even if we forget about Him,

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,860
He continues to love us.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,068
And is always ready
to come to our aid.

55
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,567
This… this…
this is so wonderful.

56
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:26,306
Yes, my son.
This is the ultimate truth.

57
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,801
Father, are you okay?

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:35,214
Yes, my boy, I’m fine,
just a bad omen.

59
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,304
Father.

60
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:46,583
What, my boy?

61
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,720
Father, tell Swamiji about
what I asked you today.

62
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
Ah, yes,

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,840
During our pilgrimage,
Ajamila made an important decision

64
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,001
He wants to receive
initiation from you.

65
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh Guruji, please
accept me as a disciple.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,029
I ask you for this mercy.

67
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,889
I will not leave this path.

68
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,360
Never?

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,830
Never!

70
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, Lochan Babu,
get your son ready.

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,182
Tomorrow I want
to see him in my ashram.

72
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:30,000
Gurudev, so you have
accepted me?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,442
Of course, my boy.

74
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,110
Father, did you hear?

75
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,287
Yes, my boy, yes,
wonderful!

76
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,699
Ajamila…

77
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:44,820
Yes, Gurudev.

78
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,591
Today marks a wonderful day,
long awaited.

79
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,940
Are you ready to be
devoted to the truth

80
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,919
in all circumstances
of your life,

81
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,000
and be faithful
to the Brahmanical vows?

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,960
I am ready, Gurudev.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,690
Do you promise to follow
the spiritual path

84
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,568
until the end of your days?

85
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,720
I promise, Gurudev

86
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,156
Name me the Brahmanical
qualities you will exhibit.

87
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:11,866
Honesty, purity, ability
to perform austerities,

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,987
calmness, freedom from
anger, all-forgiveness,

89
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:18,939
non-violence towards
any living being.

90
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,465
Ajamila.

91
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:26,623
Yes, father.

92
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:30,279
Do you remember
what you have to do today?

93
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,720
What are you talking about?

94
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,825
Ah, tomorrow we will perform…

95
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,685
Tomorrow at dawn

96
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,539
we will perform
an auspicious ceremony.

97
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,403
Of course, I remember.
I haven’t forgotten at all.

98
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:51,397
So, you should go
to the forest right now

99
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:53,699
for suitable firewood.

100
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,450
Clean, dry, an elbow’s length…

101
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,306
…pleasant to the eye.

102
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:00,680
Right.

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,692
Also, you should bring
forest flowers.

104
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,599
Clean, pleasant to the eye,
and with a good fragrance.

105
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,485
Right.
But don’t smell them!

106
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:18,076
Go right now,
you’ll be back by lunchtime.

107
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:22,902
And after lunch, we have
some chores to do.

108
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:43,950
What? Right here?
Right now? Are you sure?

109
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,518
Please! My Goddess!
Do you want me dead?

110
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,635
Goddess, I am a goddess?
Is this gold?

111
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,540
Gold! All gold!
Yes, Goddess!

112
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:06,410
Take it! All the gold
in the world! All yours!

113
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,456
Please be kind to me!

114
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:10,832
Yes? Goddess!

115
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:14,868
Yes, my fool!

116
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,048
Father, I can’t take it anymore.
Where is he?

117
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,108
…I don’t know.

118
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,872
Father, what should we do?

119
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,640
A whole day has passed,
and he’s still not back.

120
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,741
First, calm down.
Sit, eat.

121
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,519
You haven’t eaten anything
since morning.

122
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,800
A whole day has passed.

123
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:58,270
The sun is about to set,
and he’s still not back.

124
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:06,600
What if something happened to him?
What if he was attacked by robbers?

125
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,720
There are always many robbers in the forest!
Or what if he was bitten by a snake?

126
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
No!

127
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,080
It was a scorpion.

128
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,000
There are always many poisonous
scorpions in the forest.

129
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:20,750
And now my Ajamila

130
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,962
lying in the grass,
dying from its venom.

131
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,799
I will go look for him!

132
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,328
Well, say something to me.

133
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:33,448
What?

134
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,168
Well, make something up.

135
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,602
You are so vocal,
after all.

136
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:42,010
Sorry, dear, I have to go.

137
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,651
Won’t you say a word?

138
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,744
Why should I?

139
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,030
I want to hear about
your passion one more time.

140
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,990
You’ll hear it.

141
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:57,363
Later.

142
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,389
But I want it now.

143
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,453
Later. I’m in a hurry.

144
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:05,115
Well, tell me I’m a goddess.

145
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,589
Well, goddess.

146
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,010
Not like that! Say it
the way you did before!

147
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,205
Like this: “My Goddess”!

148
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:14,835
I didn’t say that.

149
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,441
What?

150
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:22,321
Like this “My Goddess”.
I never said that.

151
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:25,146
I didn’t say it like that!

152
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:28,480
Didn’t say it?
Ah, you rascal!

153
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,459
Get away from me.

154
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,800
Calm down!
Everything’s fine.

155
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,736
Nothing happened.

156
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,539
Not fine!
You’re cold-hearted!

157
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,270
A stone, that’s who you are!

158
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,392
Can’t even be nice to me.

159
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,130
Yes, I can be nice…
But later.

160
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,938
Then we’ll talk later.

161
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:55,740
So, in a week?..
My goddess?

162
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,600
Go already.

163
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,447
Bye then.

164
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,970
No daughter, you’re not going
to the forest alone. Sit down!

165
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,730
How can I just sit
and do nothing?

166
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,171
I cannot live without him.

167
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:18,086
I will pray.
I hope he returns soon.

168
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,980
Ah, daughter, daughter.

169
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:30,740
My heart hurts like
never before.

170
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:35,250
Something terrible has happened to him.
Father, I feel something terrible.

171
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,889
You are… so beautiful…
like a flower…

172
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:47,638
Flower?.. Everyone
tells me I’m a goddess!

173
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,120
Are you talking about that man?..
Who is he to you?

174
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:59,310
Man? So, you saw him, Ajamila?

175
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:03,190
I did.

176
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:06,682
And now what?

177
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:10,805
I don’t know.

178
00:14:12,115 --> 00:14:16,626
But I know. Shall I tell?

179
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,983
Come close to me.
I’ll whisper it in your ear.

180
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,800
You probably also
want to be with me here,

181
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,326
in the forest,
where no one sees us?..

182
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:46,359
You probably also
want me to love you?

183
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:51,630
You know, I’m ready.

184
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,950
Because I like you.

185
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,283
Do you hear me?
I’m ready, Ajamila. I’m ready.

186
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,220
I will be very happy
if you wear this.

187
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,155
Is that for me?

188
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,145
How lovely!

189
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:20,145
Thank you.

190
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:27,378
Why are you silent?
Do you hear me?

191
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,910
No… No!

192
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,699
Well, ok then, no.

193
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,236
Run home.

194
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:49,209
And if you change your mind
and want to find me, you will.

195
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:51,164
only…

196
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:52,540
What?

197
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,209
Money

198
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,879
what?

199
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,030
Money. Coins.
My love costs something.

200
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:12,537
And if you don’t have any,
nevermind, Brahman Ajamila.

201
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:30,740
God! God! Is this a dream? No!

202
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,799
Did this happen to me?

203
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:37,119
I have my wife Kamali!
Father… My path!

204
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,166
What’s happening to me?

205
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:20,295
Ajamila?! Where have you been?
I almost died…

206
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:24,960
Ajamila. What’s wrong with you?
What happened?

207
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,874
Nothing happened.

208
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:28,620
Where were you?

209
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,679
Collecting wood, flowers.

210
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,240
Why did it take so long?

211
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,260
Long? No, I was quick.

212
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,280
Still, Ajamila, why so long?

213
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:45,881
Nothing happened!
It just turned out that way.

214
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:46,924
Nothing happened!

215
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:52,818
Everything is fine with me!
Fine! All good!

216
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:02,004
Ajamila!

217
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:03,956
Brahman Ajamila!

218
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,851
I know you have money!

219
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:11,601
There! Give it to me,
and you’ll get something in return…

220
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:04,159
I’m ready, Ajamila. Ready.

221
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,617
Come to me! Forget everyone.

222
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:10,217
Now you have only me
in your life!

223
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,289
I will give you what
you’ve never experienced.

224
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:16,489
Just come to me…

225
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:27,837
Why didn’t we meet earlier?
We are made for each other.

226
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,877
Didn’t you realize that
after our meeting?

227
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,877
I am your fate.
I am your real life…

228
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:37,239
My embrace is gentler
than your wife’s.

229
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:41,143
Right, Ajamila?
Don’t deceive yourself.

230
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:45,094
I am much more skilled
in love than she is.

231
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:49,476
And how sweet my lips are!
What are you waiting for?

232
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,630
Taste them!

233
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,235
Prabhu, are you awake?

234
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:54,298
Why aren’t you getting up?
Are you waiting for me?

235
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,688
Yes.

236
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,128
Kamali, get up, we need
to perform the ritual today.

237
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,874
We need to prepare.

238
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:07,254
Yes, we do!

239
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:44,018
You probably also
want me to love you?

240
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:49,892
You know, I’m ready.
Because I like you.

241
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,965
Do you hear me?

242
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:54,255
Ajamila!

243
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:05,037
Purnahuti

244
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:08,964
The Lord joyfully entered
your home.

245
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:11,511
Let him stay here forever,

246
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:14,219
and bring prosperity
and peace with him.

247
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:16,877
I am your destiny.
I am your real life…

248
00:22:17,105 --> 00:22:19,690
Your blessings warm my heart.

249
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,690
Thank you for them…

250
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,226
And you are a lucky man!
You have such a son — Ajamila!

251
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,617
My embrace is gentler
than your wife’s embrace.

252
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:28,103
Right, Ajamila?

253
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:31,533
Yes… Ajamila is my hope!

254
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,387
I want him to become
better than me.

255
00:22:34,676 --> 00:22:37,310
What are you waiting for?
Taste them!

256
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,240
Ajamila!.. Ajamila!

257
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,935
Good sign, Ajamila!

258
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:44,105
The Lord sends us a good sign.

259
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,859
By the way!

260
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:18,176
To you and your son, with heartfelt
gratitude, Lochan Babu.

261
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:23,687
Money! Money… Coins…!

262
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,100
My love costs something…

263
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:34,642
…He will have beautiful
eyes like yours…

264
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,719
And let the chin be
like his grandfather’s.

265
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,158
Okay.

266
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,829
He will have beautiful
long fingers…

267
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:44,941
And when he grows up, he will be
tall, even taller than you…

268
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:49,088
Kamali, do you really think
this is possible?

269
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:50,814
My mother always said,

270
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:53,766
that parents should
first imagine their child,

271
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,497
and only then give birth.

272
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:57,669
The Lord will definitely
give us such a son,

273
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,990
as we create in our minds.

274
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,740
Ajamila, it’s actually so simple!

275
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:06,928
Well… maybe…

276
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,539
Let’s sit down here!

277
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:14,825
Madhava, Gopala…
Narayana!

278
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,933
That’s what we will
call him, Ajamila…

279
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,451
Our son…

280
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:22,633
Our little boy…
Our treasure.

281
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:27,416
Narayana. It’s so affectionate.
My Narayana!

282
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,870
Have you already imagined him?

283
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,260
Of course!
I imagine him well.

284
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,731
How do you manage that?

285
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:38,001
What?

286
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:41,288
Well… imagining, what his eyes,
what his hands will be like.

287
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:43,335
What name we’ll give him.

288
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:51,453
I just close my eyes
and see all this…

289
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:12,832
Kamali, dear, let’s go home.

290
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:16,132
Home, why? We are having
such a good time walking.

291
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:18,326
I’m feeling unwell.

292
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:24,732
Something feels wrong…

293
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,142
Is your head hurting?

294
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:31,578
Prabhu, do you even hear me?

295
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:34,473
Huh? What? Ah…
I hear you, I hear.

296
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:38,265
Yes, I hear you…

297
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:59,538
Now everything will be fine.
You will feel better soon.

298
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,780
Just rest for a bit
and you’ll feel better.

299
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:27,904
Oh Lord, what’s happening to me?

300
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:29,568
This has never happened before.

301
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:32,175
Why can’t I get her
out of my head?

302
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,443
I don’t want this!
Where is my mind?

303
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:37,686
Where is my piety?
What am I doing?

304
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:39,125
It’s not too late to stop!

305
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:43,809
My wife, my Kamali,
I can’t treat her like this.

306
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:47,728
You probably also want
to be with me here in the forest,

307
00:26:47,728 --> 00:26:51,815
where no one sees us?
Because I like you…

308
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:57,279
…And if you want
to find me, you will….

309
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,549
…My love costs something….

310
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:53,558
Forgive me. I can’t.
Her hands, voice… I can’t…

311
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:42,006
Well, you know, if you have money
— come in, but if not…

312
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,821
Not today, but I'll have it
tomorrow… You know that.

313
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:51,657
When you have it,
then you can come…

314
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,918
You can’t treat me like this,

315
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:59,296
I won’t leave you today,
I’ve left everything to come to you.

316
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:00,756
Let me go! It hurts!

317
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:05,030
"Let her go".
Stop acting innocent!

318
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:07,886
Let her go!

319
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:10,517
Who are you?

320
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:18,657
Well, come in since you’ve come.
I’ve been waiting!

321
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:22,541
Now I understand why
you didn’t want to let me in!

322
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:27,131
You were waiting for this…
Brahman…

323
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,227
And what about you?

324
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:35,647
Me? Oh, I will leave
and never come back again.

325
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:39,068
And you… very soon

326
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,083
…will turn into…

327
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,733
Well?

328
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:45,173
Into an old woman
who no one needs!

329
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:49,102
Be happy, Brahman.

330
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:54,078
We’ll meet again.

331
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,111
Well, hello, Brahman Ajamila.

332
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,111
Hello… uh…

333
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:17,414
Varsha.
That’s my name.

334
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:19,224
Hello, Varsha.

335
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,167
I thought Brahmans
sleep at this time.

336
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,779
But look, Brahmans are
fully awake and wandering.

337
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:25,918
So…

338
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,109
You’re not in a hurry?

339
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:36,443
Well then, I am not
in a hurry either. Let’s go…

340
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,395
Ajamila…

341
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:23,668
Well, come to me…

342
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:38,644
Ajamila!

343
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:40,081
Yes, Gurudev…

344
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:42,612
Once long ago, I asked you…

345
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:47,142
Are you ready to follow the principles
of religion to the end of your life

346
00:31:47,643 --> 00:31:49,647
…What did you answer me then?

347
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,282
That I am ready, Gurudev…

348
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:59,206
Ajamila…

349
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:41,550
Ajamila, is that it?

350
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,050
What do you want?

351
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,935
You were gone for almost a day,

352
00:33:45,935 --> 00:33:49,655
you come and just go to sleep?

353
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:51,954
Did you want to
tell me anything?

354
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:58,051
No way, Ajamila.
You will explain everything to me.

355
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,032
Where have you been?

356
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:03,969
Why did you make
me and your wife worry?

357
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:07,195
And where is the money
that was donated to us?

358
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,716
It was my money!

359
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,619
I earned it!
And now forget it!

360
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,253
There’s no more money.

361
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,100
How dare you raise
your voice at me?

362
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,811
Leave me alone!

363
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:32,835
Let’s go, daughter…

364
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:37,286
Let it be…

365
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,239
Where were you? And where is
the money that was donated to us?

366
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:55,420
It was my money, I earned it,

367
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,536
forget about it, there’s
no more money! Leave me alone!

368
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:01,853
Father!

369
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,605
You left early in the morning,
and now look — it’s noon.

370
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:07,468
Only a little time has passed…

371
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:12,611
I wanted to sleep, but I couldn’t.
They didn’t let me…

372
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,751
Who didn’t let you?

373
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:17,372
Well, father and wife.

374
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,190
Whose wife?

375
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:22,649
Mine.

376
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,389
So you’re married?

377
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:29,897
Yes, but it’s nothing serious.

378
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:36,561
Well, if it’s not serious for you,
it’s even less so for me.

379
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:03,405
So, you have a family…
Good…

380
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:05,267
And what did you tell them?

381
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,194
What could I tell them?

382
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:14,874
Do you not care?

383
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,915
…not really.

384
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:19,743
Though now it’s easier.

385
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:22,307
Just three days ago,
it was very hard for me.

386
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,234
But then something changed.

387
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:25,819
Something inside me burned out.

388
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:29,820
I no longer want to think
and weigh every step.

389
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,064
And to be afraid of
what others will say.

390
00:37:32,064 --> 00:37:33,967
I’ve done that my whole life.

391
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:38,813
I want to breathe freely,
to live without fear and remorse.

392
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,444
After that meeting with you,
there, in the forest…

393
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,472
I couldn’t think of
anything else but you.

394
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:50,861
Neither my family nor my duties,

395
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,712
nothing could make me
forget you.

396
00:37:54,712 --> 00:38:00,013
your hands, your voice,
your eyes.

397
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:04,503
I don’t want to play the role of
a faithful husband and loving son,

398
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,597
when here is a burning
fire inside me.

399
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:08,182
I can’t, and I don’t want to.

400
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:11,119
I just want to be with you,

401
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,353
only with you.

402
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:17,956
So what… have you
fallen in love with me?

403
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:18,956
Yes…

404
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,211
Have you really found
something special in me?

405
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:25,455
Oh! You don’t even know
how wonderful you are!

406
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:27,364
You are my perfection.

407
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:29,444
You are life itself to me!

408
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,155
I just can’t live without you!

409
00:38:32,694 --> 00:38:35,515
I want to be only with you…
only with you…

410
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:42,917
Where is he?

411
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:46,082
I just saw Ajamila…

412
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,530
He went into the house
of a well-known prostitute.

413
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:53,269
I thought so.

414
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:58,071
Will you go get him?

415
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:02,442
No. He couldn’t be
kept by a young wife,

416
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:06,376
nor by the path of religion
he has followed for so long.

417
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:11,116
If he has made his choice,
what can I do?

418
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:14,539
It’s all my fault.

419
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:20,604
I invested everything I had
in Ajamila.

420
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:25,253
But he made his own choice.

421
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:31,979
In an instant, the Lord
rid me of my pride,

422
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:35,999
my hopes, my expectations…

423
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,721
My good name…

424
00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:47,833
All I can do now is pray
that the Lord doesn’t leave him.

425
00:40:14,472 --> 00:40:17,900
So what should we do?

426
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:20,041
What do you mean?

427
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,629
You’ve been living with me
for several days now…

428
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,836
Your money has long run out.

429
00:40:25,836 --> 00:40:28,237
And you don’t have
any new money.

430
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,743
And all my… admirers…
You chased them away…

431
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:39,961
If you’re worried about money,
that’s not a problem for me.

432
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:45,346
Really? That’s good news.

433
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:51,174
Yes. It was never
a problem for me.

434
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,507
And where will we live?

435
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:58,267
Live?..

436
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:03,497
We can live at my place.

437
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,393
I will bring you to my house.

438
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:08,936
You’ll have a separate room.

439
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:12,652
If you agree to be with me —
I’ll provide for you.

440
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,978
Tell me, do Brahmans chant
something every day?

441
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:28,504
You have some mantras,
don’t you?

442
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:30,591
Three times a day…

443
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:34,284
A hymn to praise the Sun God…

444
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:38,984
Three times a day! When was
the last time you chanted them?

445
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:51,677
Well, probably last week.
That was the last time.

446
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,947
And then you found love?

447
00:41:57,454 --> 00:42:01,061
Oh come on,
I really do love you.

448
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:06,973
Love… I believe… You don’t
give up everything like that…

449
00:42:06,973 --> 00:42:07,931
And I don’t…

450
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:10,253
Okay, okay. I understand…

451
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:14,109
Tell your family that
I am… a maid.

452
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,255
If they believe it,
of course.

453
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:20,130
Tell your wife…

454
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,350
Although…
Say whatever you want…

455
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,405
But remember,
I won’t work for you.

456
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:31,255
You will be the one
bringing money to me…

457
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:34,297
For my love… Got it?

458
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:40,382
We still have time left…
How shall we spend it?

459
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:45,976
Come up to me,
I’ll whisper it in your ear.

460
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,849
You know how much
I adore you…

461
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:36,383
Ajamila… You came!
You're back!

462
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:38,996
Is this your wife?

463
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:42,467
Prabhu… Who is this woman?

464
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:46,166
Kamali, meet Varsha.

465
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:50,428
Why has she come
to our house?

466
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:53,314
She will help you
with the household.

467
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:58,969
Prabhu, am I not
managing by myself?

468
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,987
So what,
am I going to live here?

469
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,398
Yes…

470
00:44:20,514 --> 00:44:25,047
And… She…
Where will she live?

471
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:27,197
There…

472
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:30,247
Ajamila, I need a bed here.

473
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:34,826
I need shelves for my clothes
and jewelry boxes.

474
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:37,460
You will buy me jewelry,
won’t you?

475
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,423
I remember, you promised…

476
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:44,351
And tell her
not to hover over me.

477
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:48,591
This is now my home too.
And we will live here together.

478
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,497
Wait… Where are you going?

479
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,022
Now, every time she wants to cry,

480
00:44:58,022 --> 00:45:00,041
you’ll run to comfort her?

481
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,061
Do you think that’s normal?

482
00:45:02,636 --> 00:45:04,646
She is my wife!

483
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:07,902
And so?
I need attention too.

484
00:45:08,868 --> 00:45:11,340
You don’t want
to get me upset, do you?

485
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:16,261
Okay.

486
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:26,490
I want to spend tonight
in the yard.

487
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:32,976
I can no longer and do not want to
stay in this house.

488
00:45:33,993 --> 00:45:35,433
Bring a bed out for me.

489
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:43,867
Ajamila, come to your father.

490
00:45:45,608 --> 00:45:48,539
What is it, father?

491
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:57,212
My time has come, there is no one else
for me to think about but the Lord.

492
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,609
And I won’t stay here anymore.

493
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:07,379
I will leave… I hope
it will be easier for you.

494
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:10,833
Let’s go, daughter…

495
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:33,588
Ajamila, it’s getting dark.
It’s time for us to go to bed.

496
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:37,673
And you know — I need
all your attention and care.

497
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,222
Alright. Ajamila,
I am waiting for you…

498
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,386
I am waiting for you…

499
00:46:59,058 --> 00:47:02,961
Father… Father… why?

500
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:07,985
It hurts!
It hurts so much!

501
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:37,232
The stars are
so beautiful tonight!

502
00:47:38,573 --> 00:47:43,269
They have always been like this,
as long as I can remember.

503
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:48,841
I look at them every day.

504
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:53,951
My days are not like one another,

505
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:59,087
but the stars
always remain the same.

506
00:48:01,218 --> 00:48:07,957
Oh Supreme Lord,
master of my life,

507
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:13,049
You are unchanging,
like the stars in the sky.

508
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:19,394
And unchanging is
Your love for us.

509
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:24,616
Yet we, blinded by
our own pain,

510
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:30,196
cannot see Your love
in our lives…

511
00:48:31,694 --> 00:48:37,055
Oh my Narayana,
oh Merciful One,

512
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:40,620
I ask You,

513
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,447
help me to open my heart

514
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:50,617
enter into it…
I am waiting for You…

515
00:48:54,305 --> 00:48:57,899
Who is there?

516
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:03,070
My Lord, is it You?

517
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:09,594
I see You…
I recognize You!

518
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:15,307
How beautiful You are…

519
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:21,559
You have come for me…

520
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:35,468
You Yourself have come for me!
I am ready to go.

521
00:49:50,248 --> 00:49:56,321
Father! Father! Father!

522
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:06,651
Father! Father! Father!

523
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:24,317
Your father died last night.

524
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:29,284
Father!

525
00:50:29,284 --> 00:50:34,588
I pray to the Almighty give you
spiritual wisdom and strength

526
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:38,488
to never stray from the path of
righteousness and virtue.

527
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:41,240
Do not leave me,
I need your strength.

528
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:48,205
My blessings
will never leave you, son,

529
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,702
you can always count on me.

530
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:54,276
And you will come to see me
in the ashram, won’t you?

531
00:50:54,276 --> 00:50:58,906
Of course, son… We will
see each other constantly.

532
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:02,201
That’s good, that’s so good!

533
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:11,507
Father!
What have I done?

534
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,641
…what have I done…

535
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:19,816
Not only your father
died tonight…

536
00:51:19,816 --> 00:51:22,447
Tonight, your wife also died.

537
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:27,495
What? What are you saying,
Kamali?..

538
00:51:27,495 --> 00:51:32,768
The Kamali who once
married Ajamila,

539
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:35,632
a man of duty and honor,
no longer exists.

540
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,556
I can no longer stay here…

541
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,775
I want to leave.

542
00:51:47,032 --> 00:51:48,998
Are you letting me go?

543
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:08,168
I let you go…
Kamali…

544
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:13,156
Thank you, Prabhu.
Please forgive me.

545
00:52:13,156 --> 00:52:17,856
I couldn’t be
the wife you deserved.

546
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:23,839
No… You were…

547
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:31,313
Kamali… Kamali…

548
00:52:35,164 --> 00:52:40,465
Forgive me if you can.

549
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:20,324
We’ve run out of money.

550
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:25,314
I know, you’ve told me already.

551
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:29,839
And I need some more clothes.

552
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:38,625
Yesterday, I received a piece of fabric,
a pot of oil, and five silver coins.

553
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,908
What can we give
to the temple from this?

554
00:54:41,926 --> 00:54:43,526
I think three coins.

555
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:49,891
Take these coins and give them
to the head pujari.

556
00:54:49,938 --> 00:54:51,078
Yes, father.

557
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:56,750
Daughter, can we manage with two coins
and a pot of oil for a week?

558
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,102
Of course, father.

559
00:55:02,781 --> 00:55:04,120
What shall we do?

560
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:11,934
I don’t know, I’ll go
and figure it out.

561
00:55:12,815 --> 00:55:14,309
Figure it out?

562
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:17,514
Maybe it’s better
I figure it out.

563
00:55:18,043 --> 00:55:21,043
Maybe I should invite
someone over?

564
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:22,825
What?

565
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:28,433
Forget about that! I'll take care
of everything! No guests!

566
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:33,370
I’ll provide for you!
And forget about your old profession!

567
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:18,092
Do you think this junk
is worth anything?

568
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:21,183
Probably not.

569
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:27,272
Then why do you have it?

570
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,008
I’ll try to exchange it
for some rice.

571
00:56:30,008 --> 00:56:32,293
Some rice…

572
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:40,205
Tell me, dear, do you plan to
feed me anything besides rice?

573
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:49,535
I would love some fresh fish…

574
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,281
Varsha, I’ve told you
so many times!

575
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:57,481
Varsha, Varsha.
If you don’t want fish, fine.

576
00:56:57,628 --> 00:56:59,431
But I do.

577
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,175
Fried… a bit spicy…
mmm, it’s so delicious…

578
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:12,534
Here’s what I’ll tell you,
Ajamila.

579
00:57:12,726 --> 00:57:14,953
A month is a long time.

580
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:17,442
Somehow we managed it.

581
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,227
And I am going
to keep living.

582
00:57:20,967 --> 00:57:22,594
But I am going to live…

583
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:25,557
not like this.

584
00:57:26,378 --> 00:57:27,854
What do you mean?

585
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:32,713
When I was alone,
I only relied on myself.

586
00:57:33,602 --> 00:57:38,498
But now I have you.
So, please, provide for me.

587
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:42,283
Especially since…

588
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:46,406
I’ll have to eat more soon.

589
00:57:46,989 --> 00:57:49,771
Why? Are you planning
to gain weight?

590
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,213
No, but I must…

591
00:57:55,732 --> 00:57:57,480
Why are you
looking at me like that?

592
00:57:57,898 --> 00:58:01,898
We’re going to have a child.
A little Ajamila.

593
00:58:05,797 --> 00:58:11,229
Kamali, my girl, you’ve been living
with us for a year now

594
00:58:11,277 --> 00:58:14,512
Do you ever feel hungry
or in need?

595
00:58:14,512 --> 00:58:15,950
Of course not, father.

596
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,784
I’m completely satisfied
with my life.

597
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:19,474
I don’t need money.

598
00:58:19,474 --> 00:58:22,000
I love you both
with all my heart

599
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,657
You are my treasure

600
00:58:24,773 --> 00:58:25,906
but…

601
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:28,433
But what?

602
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:31,517
Well this righteous
Brahman Ajamila…

603
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:33,709
simply won't
give me a son.

604
00:58:33,739 --> 00:58:37,764
Did you hear that,
righteous Brahman?

605
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,529
Alright, alright, father!

606
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:42,370
I’ll give you grandchildren.
Lots of them.

607
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,320
Well, say something?

608
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,166
You don’t know where
babies come from?

609
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:50,348
Or do you think you
didn’t take part in this?

610
00:58:52,027 --> 00:58:55,367
No, just…

611
00:58:55,405 --> 00:58:59,405
I’m happy Varsha,
very happy… Very happy.

612
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:02,785
I have always wanted a son.

613
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:05,468
Really? Are you
telling me the truth?

614
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:08,136
You always wanted a son?

615
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:12,818
I promise, you will have a son
when the time comes. Just…

616
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:19,032
Only rice won’t be enough.
Do you understand, Ajamila?

617
00:59:33,246 --> 00:59:38,200
Look what I have…
Please, buy them …

618
00:59:41,117 --> 00:59:46,381
It’s for puja.
Maybe you’ll buy it? No…

619
00:59:48,077 --> 00:59:51,077
Look, it’s very cheap…

620
00:59:51,493 --> 00:59:57,045
Good paraphernalia.
Almost new… Would you like to buy?

621
01:00:02,914 --> 01:00:05,303
Dear sir!

622
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:10,169
I want to offer you
a very valuable item.

623
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,497
Well, if you don’t want it,
nevermind. I’ll go.

624
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:24,630
Wait… Ajamila, is that you?!

625
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:28,794
I haven’t seen you in a while

626
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:32,697
but I heard about
your wife, father…

627
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:35,909
but I understand…

628
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:38,002
You don’t understand…

629
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:40,375
No one understands me!

630
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:42,421
When I was good
in people’s eyes,

631
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:44,960
everyone greeted me,
everyone was happy to see me.

632
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,260
Hello, Ajamila!
Will you perform a ritual for us?

633
01:00:48,272 --> 01:00:50,972
But when I started living
the way I want, what happened?

634
01:00:50,972 --> 01:00:54,272
Everyone stopped even looking
at me! Afraid of sin!

635
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,558
Yes, I am living with
the woman I love,

636
01:00:57,558 --> 01:00:59,660
and want to be happy with her!

637
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,660
So what? Universal hatred?

638
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,484
Everyone wanted the right Ajamila,

639
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:07,501
but I want to be myself!

640
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:10,656
Can I do anything
for you, Ajamila?

641
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:16,103
Buy this from me.

642
01:01:19,237 --> 01:01:20,943
You have no money?

643
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,511
Please just buy it.
I’ll buy food for my family.

644
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:26,862
That’s why I came here.

645
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:33,003
Please take it.

646
01:01:37,891 --> 01:01:39,904
Thank you.

647
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:18,242
There!

648
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:29,874
Fish… So much… Why?

649
01:02:29,935 --> 01:02:32,935
Why? You asked for fish!

650
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:38,011
Fry some fish for yourself,
Varsha. And for me…

651
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:41,703
Did I hear that right?

652
01:02:41,832 --> 01:02:44,048
You heard right.

653
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,530
You’re changing, Ajamila.

654
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:03,152
You never used to eat fish…
What happened?

655
01:03:04,888 --> 01:03:07,888
There is new Ajamila.

656
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,330
The old one is gone.

657
01:03:18,073 --> 01:03:21,073
So, how was your day?
Successful?

658
01:03:36,606 --> 01:03:40,599
Although, you don’t have to say,
your face says it all.

659
01:03:45,097 --> 01:03:48,097
Was today successful?

660
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:52,079
Absolutely!

661
01:04:01,622 --> 01:04:04,622
Dear sir,
are you playing fair?

662
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:07,322
You want to insult me,
esteemed one?

663
01:04:07,529 --> 01:04:09,821
Honesty is my middle name!

664
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:12,268
Well then, let’s play.

665
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:15,620
Now we’re talking!
And do you have money?

666
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:18,682
Of course, I do.

667
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,416
Dice don’t like playing for nothing!
Dice need respect!

668
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,695
So, shall we play?

669
01:04:41,622 --> 01:04:43,657
I won!

670
01:04:48,476 --> 01:04:52,204
Alright! You’re lucky today.
Move aside, let another try.

671
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:55,967
I want to play too!
I’ll bet one coin!

672
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,800
Alright, let’s do it.

673
01:05:09,181 --> 01:05:11,181
He won! He won!

674
01:05:11,181 --> 01:05:14,181
Well done!

675
01:05:14,502 --> 01:05:17,502
Brother, you’re lucky today.

676
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,211
One more time.

677
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:31,056
If only luck would
come my way!

678
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:45,034
Maybe I should play too?
Maybe I’ll get lucky?

679
01:05:46,746 --> 01:05:51,582
Ah, shame I didn’t bring money.
I would play too!

680
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:57,188
Well, well, well…
What did he roll?

681
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:01,927
Ah, he lost.
I knew it, he’s a loser.

682
01:06:02,263 --> 01:06:04,855
Tough luck for you!

683
01:06:04,947 --> 01:06:07,947
It’s alright, honorable one,
next time you’ll get luck.

684
01:06:08,114 --> 01:06:11,114
Let’s get out of here,
why stand, staring? Let’s go.

685
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:14,671
Come on, hang in there.

686
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,417
Money and greed —
a beautiful combination,

687
01:06:21,747 --> 01:06:24,747
when you know how to use them.

688
01:06:27,801 --> 01:06:29,002
How’s our baby?

689
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:31,646
He’s moving non-stop.

690
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:49,331
Married to a Brahmin.
Who would imagine?

691
01:07:50,448 --> 01:07:52,981
Good day, pilgrims.

692
01:07:53,129 --> 01:07:55,349
Peace be upon you, good sir.

693
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:58,349
Where are you heading?

694
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:02,919
We’re visiting holy places.
Heading to blessed Prayag now.

695
01:08:06,076 --> 01:08:08,515
Our pilgrimage has come to an end.

696
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:14,247
We're going to rest today, take a bath,
and tomorrow we will…

697
01:08:14,247 --> 01:08:17,223
…perform auspicious rituals
and feed the Brahmins.

698
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:21,223
Right! To mark the end
of our journey!

699
01:08:21,386 --> 01:08:24,386
As the sacred texts say.

700
01:08:27,484 --> 01:08:33,511
Why are you, a healthy man, leading
the blind and giving them your time?

701
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:36,109
You’re like in prison with them!

702
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:37,868
You’re not your own master.

703
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:40,719
Walking with them,
caring for them.

704
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:44,423
You can’t leave them
even for a minute.

705
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:45,629
What else is human life for?

706
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:48,500
If not to help others
and serve the Lord

707
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:50,524
how else should we
spend our time?

708
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:54,828
Time should be spent wisely.
Not wandering aimlessly.

709
01:08:55,856 --> 01:08:57,822
These people are my destiny.

710
01:08:57,881 --> 01:09:00,792
Together, we visit holy places
and pray to the Lord.

711
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:04,390
Dad, you’re a Brahmin yourself,

712
01:09:04,492 --> 01:09:06,818
are you going to make
gifts to yourself?

713
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:11,723
Even though we’re Brahmins,
we too must engage in charity

714
01:09:12,388 --> 01:09:17,479
and use all money for
serving the Lord and holy people.

715
01:09:19,566 --> 01:09:22,566
Now let’s check your bags,

716
01:09:23,656 --> 01:09:26,001
shake your clothes a little.

717
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,875
Maybe a coin will jingle!

718
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:32,153
No! Leave these people in peace!
We won’t touch anyone!

719
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:35,296
What? If you can’t do it
yourself, don’t stop us.

720
01:09:36,894 --> 01:09:39,894
Look at that brahmin…

721
01:09:45,901 --> 01:09:51,711
So, so… aha… what’s this?
Come on, let’s see…

722
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:56,493
Come on, show me,
what’s in your bag?

723
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,851
Maybe hiding something
in your turban? Come on, show it!

724
01:10:02,927 --> 01:10:05,122
Aha, what about you?

725
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,679
You too, turn around.

726
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:15,699
Look at this, said
they were poor pilgrims!

727
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:18,890
Look, I found a coin too.

728
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,399
Look at that, not bad…

729
01:10:25,702 --> 01:10:29,373
Here you go…
Alright, go now…

730
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:49,792
Ajamila, what in the world?

731
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:53,446
In our profession,
your cowardice can cost a life.

732
01:10:53,862 --> 01:10:56,862
Either you’re with us
or you can go to hell.

733
01:11:00,663 --> 01:11:01,311
So?

734
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:06,254
Okay…

735
01:11:06,442 --> 01:11:08,034
Okay what?

736
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,441
I’m with you…

737
01:11:18,048 --> 01:11:19,917
I’m with you.

738
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:23,715
That’s good, Ajamila.
But remember…

739
01:11:23,715 --> 01:11:26,715
There won’t be a second time.

740
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:44,762
Brahman

741
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,142
Who are you?

742
01:11:49,095 --> 01:11:51,101
Om Tat Sat

743
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:54,991
Swaha. Purnahuti.

744
01:12:01,419 --> 01:12:06,044
Leave them! Empty…

745
01:12:07,418 --> 01:12:10,418
Om Tat Sat

746
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:15,372
Om Tat Sat

747
01:12:18,263 --> 01:12:22,270
Let’s go to Prayag!

748
01:12:25,334 --> 01:12:29,007
Of course, on foot

749
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:33,561
God is with us

750
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:39,607
Used to be a Brahman, now robber…

751
01:12:39,765 --> 01:12:44,025
with a knife. And they’re pilgrims…

752
01:12:44,309 --> 01:12:48,686
Be damned, Brahman Ajamila!

753
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:52,283
Be damned!

754
01:13:35,947 --> 01:13:38,566
Who invented that wine?

755
01:13:38,732 --> 01:13:42,840
It’s tough with it,
and tough without it.

756
01:13:43,588 --> 01:13:46,588
What, can’t get yesterday’s
blind men out of your head?

757
01:13:50,498 --> 01:13:53,291
It was hard for me at first too.

758
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,320
They’re holy pilgrims,
and we rob them.

759
01:13:58,095 --> 01:13:59,246
And then?

760
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,807
Then I got used to it,
it became easier.

761
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:06,824
It’s my job,
and their fate.

762
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:11,411
The past doesn’t let go easily.

763
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:13,945
It will.

764
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:18,941
Yeah, the sooner the better.

765
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,340
Give me the money!

766
01:14:36,026 --> 01:14:40,123
Do you hear me? Or I’ll finish off
your whole miserable family!

767
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:42,405
Where’s the money, I said!

768
01:15:12,486 --> 01:15:14,412
This is for you.

769
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,125
Where did you get them?

770
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:45,222
Doesn’t matter.
It’s for you.

771
01:15:47,226 --> 01:15:49,824
I know you didn’t buy these.

772
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:52,625
But you know I can’t
wear this on the street.

773
01:15:52,701 --> 01:15:55,104
Someone will surely
recognize their jewelry.

774
01:15:57,195 --> 01:16:00,195
Then why did you bring it?

775
01:16:01,952 --> 01:16:05,595
Listen, your occupation
becomes very dangerous.

776
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,010
The town is buzzing with talk
about robbers in the forest.

777
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:13,733
The king has already sent
a squad of his best warriors,

778
01:16:13,971 --> 01:16:16,155
to catch the robbers
and bring them to trial.

779
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:19,463
And the king has already come up
with most terrible punishment…

780
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:20,691
What is that?

781
01:16:20,948 --> 01:16:24,072
The king ordered the robbers to
have their hands and feet severed.

782
01:16:24,072 --> 01:16:27,072
But spare their lives
as a warning to others.

783
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:39,641
So better get rid of this…
Give it to jewelers to melt it down.

784
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:56,008
Kamali… is that you?

785
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,109
Kamali… how… why…

786
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,919
Sir, you’re mistaken.
That woman is dead.

787
01:20:17,892 --> 01:20:19,706
I’m just a simple beggar.

788
01:20:21,038 --> 01:20:23,276
Sir, we’re just beggars.

789
01:20:24,814 --> 01:20:27,814
Keep going your way.
This is not a place for you.

790
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:52,219
Ajamila, Kamali’s fate
is on your hands…

791
01:20:52,437 --> 01:20:55,437
Don’t forget that.

792
01:20:56,387 --> 01:21:00,014
Sir, you’re mistaken.
That woman is dead.

793
01:21:44,847 --> 01:21:46,408
Hello Varsha.

794
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,705
I see… brought the debt?

795
01:21:51,042 --> 01:21:52,594
Yes, of course!

796
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:01,833
Good! What else?

797
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,124
I missed you.

798
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:07,869
Missed me? Maybe also say
you’re crazy about me,

799
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,148
And that you can’t live
without me?

800
01:22:10,308 --> 01:22:11,015
Exactly.

801
01:22:14,008 --> 01:22:17,008
So maybe you’ll even
marry me, huh?

802
01:22:34,165 --> 01:22:37,165
Maybe you’ll let
an old friend inside?

803
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:47,010
What if Ajamila comes?

804
01:22:47,702 --> 01:22:48,905
He won’t come.

805
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:52,807
But what if he does?

806
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:55,294
He won’t come.

807
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:15,459
Father, look how beautiful
it is here!

808
01:23:18,419 --> 01:23:21,145
What… what are you doing?

809
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,240
Wait! Wait! I’ll give you
all the money!

810
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,370
Son, my boy…

811
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:31,899
He’s dead.
You killed him.

812
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:33,771
What makes you say that?

813
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:38,741
Hey! Get up! Wake up!

814
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:42,462
Wake up, open your eyes…

815
01:23:46,278 --> 01:23:49,278
…I didn’t mean to…

816
01:23:49,874 --> 01:23:51,262
didn’t mean to…

817
01:23:51,941 --> 01:23:54,941
no… no… not this…

818
01:23:55,650 --> 01:24:00,600
His wife and children are waiting…
Do you have children?

819
01:24:08,052 --> 01:24:09,626
Dad, are you leaving already?

820
01:24:10,834 --> 01:24:12,383
Will you bring gifts?

821
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:21,056
Will you take this money
to your family?

822
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:24,500
Don’t preach to me about morals!

823
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,483
I know everything myself!
I didn’t mean to kill! I didn’t want to!

824
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:31,355
I only need money!
Nothing else! Just the money!

825
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:37,468
I don’t need your miserable lives!
I don’t need anything! Nothing!

826
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:45,282
Will you take this money to your family?
Do you think they’ll be happier?

827
01:24:45,282 --> 01:24:49,812
You want to make someone happy,
by killing and bringing grief to others?

828
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,895
Well, I’m leaving.
I have to go.

829
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:11,277
Yes, of course.

830
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,131
Here, take this.

831
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,401
I think we’ll have
another son.

832
01:26:45,402 --> 01:26:49,100
What, Ajamila? We already
have so many sons.

833
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:52,427
I want us to have a daughter.

834
01:26:52,754 --> 01:26:55,754
And we’ll name her…
Kumari.

835
01:26:56,199 --> 01:27:00,228
In honor of
Lord Mahadeva’s wife.

836
01:27:05,411 --> 01:27:07,622
Prabhu, I respect the sages,

837
01:27:07,692 --> 01:27:10,940
but I’d really love our son
to have the name of the Lord

838
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:11,497
but…

839
01:27:11,497 --> 01:27:14,497
No, Don’t argue.
The name of God.

840
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:17,094
Please. Don’t argue.

841
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:20,632
Alright, alright.

842
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:33,474
Madhava… Gopala…
Narayana!

843
01:27:34,105 --> 01:27:34,975
What Narayana?

844
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:37,982
That will be his name, Ajamila.
Our son.

845
01:27:38,549 --> 01:27:41,549
Our little boy…
Our treasure.

846
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,222
Narayana.

847
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:46,687
No.

848
01:27:46,987 --> 01:27:51,606
Our son’s name will be Narayana.
That will bring us luck.

849
01:27:52,748 --> 01:27:57,127
Ajamila, if you want
to philosophize, go outside.

850
01:27:57,463 --> 01:27:59,532
I am going to sleep.

851
01:28:13,437 --> 01:28:16,437
Dad! Dad! You’re back!

852
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:20,491
I love you my boy!

853
01:28:21,433 --> 01:28:22,954
I love you too, dad.

854
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:24,934
Where are your brothers?

855
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:26,495
They went to the river.

856
01:28:27,248 --> 01:28:28,537
Why didn’t you go with them?

857
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:31,537
It’s boring with them.
I was waiting for you, dad.

858
01:28:52,354 --> 01:28:54,227
Dad, catch!

859
01:29:00,175 --> 01:29:05,503
Dad, come on throw it…
Dad, seriously.

860
01:29:09,264 --> 01:29:11,889
Dad, that’s not fair!

861
01:29:12,143 --> 01:29:15,143
Always be on guard!
Then you can win!

862
01:29:47,517 --> 01:29:49,905
Why are you so sad, dad?

863
01:29:50,857 --> 01:29:53,857
Nothing… all fine.

864
01:29:54,745 --> 01:29:57,745
I’ll go…
take some rest.

865
01:30:13,036 --> 01:30:21,235
Ajamila, why did you do that…
You killed me, Ajamila…

866
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:29,782
Be damned… Are you happy now?
Ajamila… Ajamila…

867
01:30:29,782 --> 01:30:36,479
Why did you do that?
Now you'll have a different life…

868
01:30:37,147 --> 01:30:40,732
Come with us… Ajamila….

869
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:42,312
Don’t touch me!

870
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:44,334
You robbed me…
You betrayed me!

871
01:30:44,334 --> 01:30:49,050
Leave me alone…
I didn’t mean to kill you…

872
01:30:49,525 --> 01:30:52,525
Don’t touch… Murderer…

873
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:55,619
Stop, go away!

874
01:30:55,892 --> 01:31:00,731
I didn’t want to,
didn’t want to!

875
01:31:00,927 --> 01:31:07,379
Be damned…
Why…

876
01:31:41,157 --> 01:31:43,738
What happened, son?

877
01:31:44,036 --> 01:31:49,079
You fainted and mom said
that you had a stroke.

878
01:31:56,066 --> 01:32:00,569
Narayana, my boy!
Do not leave me.

879
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:03,670
I’m scared!

880
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:08,062
I love you Narayana

881
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:12,940
I love your mom
and your brothers

882
01:32:13,418 --> 01:32:19,569
Out of love for you
I’ve done many things…

883
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:23,463
which is why I’m so scared now…

884
01:32:24,923 --> 01:32:29,085
Money! Where’s the money?
Give me the money!

885
01:32:29,162 --> 01:32:32,348
Or I’ll finish all your
miserable family!!

886
01:32:32,371 --> 01:32:36,517
Where is the money I ask?
I need more! Give me all the money!

887
01:33:01,604 --> 01:33:05,144
Would the Lord do that for me?
Father, did you hear?

888
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:06,970
I will not leave this path!

889
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:08,666
Never? Never!

890
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:13,531
And you will get something in return…
It’s all my fault…

891
01:33:13,531 --> 01:33:16,021
Come to me…

892
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:19,445
Sir, you are mistaken.
That woman died.

893
01:33:19,445 --> 01:33:22,725
Go bring me rice, fish, vegetables —
I have nothing to feed the children!

894
01:33:22,756 --> 01:33:26,751
I hate you, I hate you!!
Hate you! Hate you!!

895
01:33:29,283 --> 01:33:31,890
You, it’s because of you!

896
01:33:32,066 --> 01:33:36,403
Shut up! Better remember
who came to me first.

897
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,608
Who told me about love,
promised something?

898
01:33:39,608 --> 01:33:42,608
Brought me money,
5 silver coins.

899
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,718
Who searched for me all night
like a madman?

900
01:33:45,718 --> 01:33:48,718
Who brought me here?

901
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:54,509
It was you, Ajamila, you.
So you better be quiet.

902
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:58,959
I just helped you to fulfill
what you dreamed of.

903
01:34:03,894 --> 01:34:06,894
Dad, is everything okay?

904
01:34:08,556 --> 01:34:11,556
Too late.

905
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:17,390
It’s too late to change anything.

906
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:24,220
My life is coming to an end.

907
01:34:29,152 --> 01:34:35,609
I’ve done too much
that won’t let me die in peace.

908
01:35:41,794 --> 01:35:44,794
Well, not much.

909
01:35:52,475 --> 01:35:54,257
Where are you going?

910
01:35:55,582 --> 01:35:58,582
Money won’t fall
from the sky on us.

911
01:36:00,449 --> 01:36:03,449
Yes, that’s for sure.

912
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:47,144
Thief! Thief! Get out of here!
Murderer! Go away! Thief!

913
01:36:47,524 --> 01:36:52,247
That’s the same godless man!
Look at this rascal!

914
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,417
Thief! Thief!
This is not a place for you!

915
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:59,010
Comes with a child and thinks
everyone will forget about what he did?

916
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:02,548
Get out! Get out of here!
Keep walking!

917
01:37:02,548 --> 01:37:05,548
This is not a place for you!

918
01:37:05,548 --> 01:37:07,890
Who does he think we are?
Don’t even come near us!

919
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:10,890
Go, go! Get away from here!
Look what he’s thinking!

920
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:14,263
Leave! You’ve lost your decency!
This is our place!

921
01:37:14,263 --> 01:37:17,623
This is our place! Rascal!
There’s nothing for you!

922
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:20,931
Why did they chase you away?
Why do they hate you?

923
01:37:21,107 --> 01:37:24,107
This is their place, son.
We’re not welcomed there.

924
01:37:24,117 --> 01:37:28,870
But no one can claim the road
for themselves. It is public!

925
01:37:29,723 --> 01:37:35,556
It’s okay, son. It’s okay.
I’ll sit by myself. You go.

926
01:37:41,498 --> 01:37:43,001
You go.

927
01:37:43,779 --> 01:37:46,779
I can stay with you, dad.

928
01:37:47,227 --> 01:37:51,110
I won’t be bored.
I will sing. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma!

929
01:37:52,675 --> 01:37:55,675
No, son, you better go.

930
01:37:56,319 --> 01:37:58,354
Come back for me
in the evening.

931
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:01,981
I need to be alone…

932
01:38:02,416 --> 01:38:08,587
Okay, dad. I will go.
Wait for me, don’t get sad.

933
01:38:11,767 --> 01:38:14,767
Hello, beggar Ajamila.

934
01:38:15,243 --> 01:38:18,243
Today your new life has begun.

935
01:38:56,747 --> 01:38:59,747
Is it hard for you, Ajamila?

936
01:39:02,931 --> 01:39:06,833
You are not young anymore…
Must have seen a lot, haven’t you?

937
01:39:08,006 --> 01:39:11,006
Yes, I’ve seen a lot.

938
01:39:11,935 --> 01:39:16,718
You wanted happiness, but instead
you’re afraid to look people in the eyes.

939
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:20,072
I know…

940
01:39:20,072 --> 01:39:22,349
You chose this life for yourself.

941
01:39:22,349 --> 01:39:25,349
…stop it!
Why are you torturing me?

942
01:39:25,758 --> 01:39:28,758
Don’t you need help?

943
01:39:29,101 --> 01:39:33,659
I’m not young, I have
a heavy burden on my back.

944
01:39:34,309 --> 01:39:37,309
Only death will help.

945
01:39:54,547 --> 01:39:57,547
Here we are, Ajamila!

946
01:39:57,856 --> 01:40:00,856
We’ve been waiting for you
for so long!

947
01:40:06,289 --> 01:40:09,289
Who, who are you?

948
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:15,226
Your new friends!..
Don’t be afraid of us!…

949
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,380
What do you want from me?

950
01:40:21,994 --> 01:40:26,111
Where are you going, we haven’t
properly introduced ourselves yet.

951
01:40:26,526 --> 01:40:31,221
No, no… Where… Don’t…
Where are you taking me?

952
01:40:31,305 --> 01:40:37,153
Home! To the underworld! It’s time to
appear before Yamaraja’s court!

953
01:40:37,152 --> 01:40:44,375
No… I haven’t finished yet,
I still have so much to do.

954
01:40:44,394 --> 01:40:47,394
All your work is already finished.

955
01:40:50,847 --> 01:40:53,915
I have a family,
I have a little son.

956
01:40:53,915 --> 01:40:57,904
Narayana!! Narayana!!
NARAYANA!!!

957
01:40:57,921 --> 01:41:00,921
Stop!

958
01:41:01,429 --> 01:41:03,062
Who are you?

959
01:41:03,062 --> 01:41:07,225
And how dare you interfere with us,
the servants of Yamaraja?!

960
01:41:07,272 --> 01:41:09,293
God of death!

961
01:41:09,293 --> 01:41:12,070
We are the messengers of
the Supreme Lord Narayana.

962
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:15,702
Let go of this man,
he is no longer in your power.

963
01:41:16,408 --> 01:41:19,408
Let go of whom, Ajamila?

964
01:41:19,441 --> 01:41:22,745
The Earth did not know
a greater sinner than him.

965
01:41:23,135 --> 01:41:30,365
He was a Brahman, but fell for
a prostitute and became a criminal.

966
01:41:30,374 --> 01:41:35,544
The darkest, most terrifying
regions of hell await for him!

967
01:41:35,544 --> 01:41:38,544
Ajamila has already atoned
for all his sins.

968
01:41:38,745 --> 01:41:42,745
In despair, he spoke
the Holy Name of Lord Narayana!

969
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:47,783
Sins are atoned by tough
austerities and penances.

970
01:41:47,783 --> 01:41:53,062
And him saying the Holy Name
is accidental!

971
01:41:53,134 --> 01:41:57,556
He was just calling his son!
Yes Yes!!

972
01:41:58,592 --> 01:42:01,592
Like fire burns dry grass to ashes,

973
01:42:01,603 --> 01:42:05,349
so is the Holy Name of the Lord —
burns away all the sinful reactions,

974
01:42:06,187 --> 01:42:09,187
even if it is said unintentionally.

975
01:42:09,453 --> 01:42:12,453
You must release this man!

976
01:42:13,741 --> 01:42:16,569
Okay, you win.

977
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:20,578
Well, buddy,
we’ll see you soon!

978
01:42:20,743 --> 01:42:23,743
We’ll come back for you.

979
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:31,978
Lord, Lord… I’ve done nothing
worthwile in my entire life,

980
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:36,462
I only sinned, I only tarnished
the name of Brahmins.

981
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:42,058
But You, You’ve sent
your great servants,

982
01:42:42,151 --> 01:42:47,567
and they were able to save me
from the hands of death. You saved me.

983
01:42:47,975 --> 01:42:54,009
I promise you — this old Ajamila
will never forget you again!

984
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:59,479
I promise to never again
return to my past life!

985
01:42:59,592 --> 01:43:02,592
Never. Never.

986
01:43:03,588 --> 01:43:06,588
You gave me another chance!

987
01:43:06,658 --> 01:43:09,658
Your Holy Name saved me.

988
01:43:09,955 --> 01:43:13,299
Your Holy Name is
infinitely merciful…

989
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:21,057
Dad, dad, wait!
The city is the other way.

990
01:43:21,189 --> 01:43:25,163
I’m leaving, son. I’m leaving to
dedicate my life to the Lord.

991
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:28,279
Lord Narayana?

992
01:43:28,434 --> 01:43:31,434
Yes, son. Lord Narayana.

993
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:35,258
Where will you go?

994
01:43:35,335 --> 01:43:38,335
I lived my life in vain,
I spent so many years in sin.

995
01:43:40,150 --> 01:43:43,150
Now I am leaving
for Haridwar, Narayana.

996
01:43:43,294 --> 01:43:45,887
To stay there forever.

997
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:48,965
And never, never
ever stop serving the Lord.

998
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:55,036
I’m leaving, son.
Goodbye Narayana…

999
01:43:55,114 --> 01:43:58,114
Goodbye son…

1000
01:44:21,837 --> 01:44:24,246
Dad, dad…
