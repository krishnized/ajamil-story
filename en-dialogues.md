Ajamila: There seem to be too many poor lately!
Friend: What do you mean?
Ajamila: Whoever you stop, you find nothing of value. Just pennies.
Friend: Hey, Ajamila…
Ajamila: You weren’t always like this…
Friend: Like what?
Ajamila: Well… involved in what you are doing now.
Friend: Why do you ask?
Ajamila: Just curious.
Friend: Yes, there was a different Ajamila once… A different life… everything was different.
Ajamila: And what did you do?
Friend: I was a Brahmin… A priest.

2.

Father: …and then he rushes to Prahlada, shakes him by the shoulders and screams: “Where, where is your Vishnu? Show Him!”
Son: And Prahlada?
Father: And Prahlada looks him in the eyes and replies with a smile: “Dear father, look close and you’ll see the Lord everywhere.”
Son: And then?
Father: And then Hiranyakashipu screams: “So, your Vishnu is in my house?” Prahlada replies with a smile: “Yes, father, the Lord is always in our house.” Then Hiranyakashipu grabs his sword and starts swinging it, shouting: “Vishnu! Vishnu! If You’re here, come out!” And when Hiranyakashipu saw no one, he rushed at Prahlada with his sword, saying: “If your Vishnu doesn’t appear before me now, I’ll cut off your head!”
Son: And Prahlada?
Father: Prahlada, this little boy, tells his father: “Here He is, my Lord, right before you.” Hiranyakashipu points at a pillar and yells: “Is he in this pillar?”
Father: Yes, father, can’t you see?
Father: And then Hiranyakashipu grabs his sword and with all his might strikes the pillar… But you know, Ajamila, no one heard the sound of the broken pillar.
Son: Why?
Father: Because at that moment, there was a deafening roar of a lion, and the magnificent Lord Vishnu appeared. They fought for a long time and then Lord Narasimhadev grabbed Hiranyakashipu, put him on his knees and with his sharp claws tore him to pieces. And so saved his dear devotee Prahlada.
Son: And would the Lord do the same for me? Come to me and save me from demons?
Father: Of course, Ajamila. The Lord’s love is unchanging. Even if we forget about Him, He continues to love us. And is always ready to come to our aid.
Son: This… this… this is so wonderful.
Father: Yes, my son. This is the ultimate truth.
Son: Father, are you okay?
Father: Yes, my boy, I’m fine, just a bad omen.

3.

Father: Father.
Ajamila: What, my boy?
Ajamila: Father, tell Swamiji about what I asked you today.
Father: Ah, yes, during our pilgrimage, Ajamila made an important decision.
Father: He wants to receive initiation from you.
Ajamila: Oh Guruji, please accept me as a disciple.
Ajamila: I ask you for this mercy.
Ajamila: I will not leave this path.
Guru: Never?
Ajamila: Never!
Guru: Well, Lochan Babu, get your son ready.
Guru: Tomorrow I want to see him in my ashram.
Ajamila: Gurudev, so you have accepted me?
Guru: Of course, my boy.
Ajamila: Father, did you hear?
Father: Yes, my boy, yes, wonderful!

4.

Guru: Ajamila…
Ajamila: Yes, Gurudev.
Guru: Today marks a wonderful day, long awaited. Are you ready to be devoted to the truth in all circumstances of your life, and be faithful to the Brahmanical vows?
Ajamila: I am ready, Gurudev.
Guru: Do you promise to follow the spiritual path until the end of your days?
Ajamila: I promise, Gurudev.
Guru: Name me the Brahmanical qualities you will exhibit.
Ajamila: Honesty, purity, ability to perform austerities, calmness, freedom from anger, all-forgiveness, non-violence towards any living being.

5.

Father: Ajamila.
Ajamila: Yes, father.
Father: Do you remember what you have to do today?
Ajamila: What are you talking about?
Ajamila: Ah, tomorrow we will perform…
Father: Tomorrow at dawn we will perform an auspicious ceremony.
Ajamila: Of course, I remember. I haven’t forgotten at all.
Father: So, you should go to the forest right now for suitable firewood.
Father: Clean, dry, an elbow’s length…
Ajamila: pleasant to the eye.
Father: Right.
Father: Also, you should bring forest flowers.
Ajamila: Clean, pleasant to the eye, and with a good fragrance.
Father: Right. But don’t smell them!
Father: Go right now, you’ll be back by lunchtime.
Father: And after lunch, we have some chores to do.

6.

Varsha: What? Right here? Right now? Are you sure?
Man: Please! My Goddess! Do you want me dead?
Varsha: Goddess, I am a goddess? Is this gold?
Man: Gold! All gold! Yes, Goddess!
Man: Take it! All the gold in the world! All yours!
Man: Please be kind to me!
Varsha: Yes? Goddess!
Man: Yes, my fool!

7.

Father: Father, I can’t take it anymore. Where is he?
Kamali: …I don’t know.
Father: Father, what should we do?
Kamali: A whole day has passed, and he’s still not back.
Father: First, calm down. Sit, eat. You haven’t eaten anything since morning.
Kamali: A whole day has passed. The sun is about to set, and he’s still not back.
Father: What if something happened to him? What if he was attacked by robbers?
Kamali: There are always many robbers in the forest! Or what if he was bitten by a snake?
Father: No! It was a scorpion. There are always many poisonous scorpions in the forest. And now my Ajamila lying in the grass, dying from its venom.
Kamali: I will go look for him!

8.

Varsha: Well, say something to me.
Man: What?
Varsha: Well, make something up. You are so vocal, after all.
Man: Sorry, dear, I have to go.
Varsha: Won’t you say a word?
Man: Why should I?
Varsha: I want to hear about your passion one more time.
Man: You’ll hear it. Later.
Varsha: But I want it now.
Man: Later. I’m in a hurry.
Varsha: Well, tell me I’m a goddess.
Man: Well, goddess.
Varsha: Not like that! Say it the way you did before! Like this: “My Goddess”!
Man: I didn’t say that.
Varsha: What?
Man: Like this “My Goddess”. I never said that.
Varsha: I didn’t say it like that!
Man: Didn’t say it? Ah, you rascal!
Varsha: Get away from me.
Man: Calm down! Everything’s fine. Nothing happened.
Varsha: Not fine! You’re cold-hearted! A stone, that’s who you are! Can’t even be nice to me.
Man: Yes, I can be nice… But later.
Varsha: Then we’ll talk later.
Man: So, in a week?.. My goddess?
Varsha: Go already.
Man: Bye then.

9.

Father: No daughter, you’re not going to the forest alone. Sit down!
Kamali: How can I just sit and do nothing?
Kamali: I cannot live without him.
Kamali: I will pray. I hope he returns soon.
Father: Ah, daughter, daughter.
Kamali: My heart hurts like never before.
Kamali: Something terrible has happened to him. Father, I feel something terrible.

10.

Varsha: You are… so beautiful… like a flower…
Ajamila: Flower?.. Everyone tells me I’m a goddess!
Varsha: Are you talking about that man?.. Who is he to you?
Ajamila: Man? So, you saw him, Ajamila?
Varsha: I did.
Ajamila: And now what?
Varsha: I don’t know.
Ajamila: But I know. Shall I tell?
Varsha: Come close to me. I’ll whisper it in your ear.
Ajamila: You probably also want to be with me here, in the forest, where no one sees us?..
Varsha: You probably also want me to love you?
Ajamila: You know, I’m ready.
Varsha: Because I like you. Do you hear me? I’m ready, Ajamila. I’m ready.

Ajamila:I will be very happy if you wear this.
Kamali: Is that for me? How lovely! Thank you.

Varsha: Why are you silent? Do you hear me?
Ajamila: No… No!
Varsha: Well, ok then, no. Run home.
Ajamila: And if you change your mind and want to find me, you will.
Varsha: Only…
Ajamila: What?
Varsha: Money.
Ajamila: What?
Varsha: Money. Coins. My love costs something.
Ajamila: And if you don’t have any, never mind, Brahman Ajamila.
Ajamila: God! God! Is this a dream? No!
Ajamila: Did this happen to me?
Ajamila: I have my wife Kamali! Father… My path!
Ajamila: What’s happening to me?

11.

Kamali: Ajamila?! Where have you been? I almost died…
Ajamila: Ajamila. What’s wrong with you? What happened?
Kamali: Nothing happened.
Father: Where were you?
Ajamila: Collecting wood, flowers.
Father: Why did it take so long?
Ajamila: Long? No, I was quick.
Father: Still, Ajamila, why so long?
Ajamila: Nothing happened! It just turned out that way.
Ajamila: Nothing happened!
Ajamila: Everything is fine with me! Fine! All good!

12.

Varsha: Ajamila!
Varsha: Brahman Ajamila!
Varsha: I know you have money!
Varsha: There! Give it to me, and you’ll get something in return…
Varsha: I’m ready, Ajamila. Ready.
Varsha: Come to me! Forget everyone.
Varsha: Now you have only me in your life!
Varsha: I will give you what you’ve never experienced.
Varsha: Just come to me…
Varsha: Why didn’t we meet earlier? We are made for each other.
Varsha: Didn’t you realize that after our meeting?
Varsha: I am your fate. I am your real life…
Varsha: My embrace is gentler than your wife’s.
Varsha: Right, Ajamila? Don’t deceive yourself.
Varsha: I am much more skilled in love than she is.
Varsha: And how sweet my lips are! What are you waiting for?
Varsha: Taste them!

13.

Kamali: Prabhu, are you awake?
Ajamila: Why aren’t you getting up? Are you waiting for me?
Kamali: Yes.
Ajamila: Kamali, get up, we need to perform the ritual today.
Kamali: We need to prepare.
Ajamila: Yes, we do!
Varsha:You probably also want me to love you? You know, I’m ready. Because I like you. Do you hear me? Ajamila!

14.

Father: Purnahuti.
Father: The Lord joyfully entered your home.
Father: Let him stay here forever, and bring prosperity and peace with him.
Varsha: I am your destiny. I am your real life…
Father: Your blessings warm my heart.
Father: Thank you for them…
Father: And you are a lucky man! You have such a son — Ajamila!
Varsha: My embrace is gentler than your wife’s embrace.
Father: Right, Ajamila?
Father: Yes… Ajamila is my hope!
Father: I want him to become better than me.
Varsha: What are you waiting for? Taste them!
Father: Ajamila!.. Ajamila!
Father: Good sign, Ajamila!
Father: The Lord sends us a good sign.
Father: By the way!
Father: To you and your son, with heartfelt gratitude, Lochan Babu.
Varsha: Money! Money… Coins…!
Varsha: My love costs something…

15.

Kamali: …He will have beautiful eyes like yours…
Kamali: And let the chin be like his grandfather’s.
Ajamila: Okay.
Kamali: He will have beautiful long fingers…
Kamali: And when he grows up, he will be tall, even taller than you…
Ajamila: Kamali, do you really think this is possible?
Kamali: My mother always said, that parents should first imagine their child, and only then give birth.
Kamali: The Lord will definitely give us such a son, as we create in our minds.
Kamali: Ajamila, it’s actually so simple!
Ajamila: Well… maybe…
Kamali: Let’s sit down here!
Kamali: Madhava, Gopala… Narayana!
Kamali: That’s what we will call him, Ajamila… Our son…
Kamali: Our little boy… Our treasure.
Kamali: Narayana. It’s so affectionate. My Narayana!
Ajamila: Have you already imagined him?
Kamali: Of course! I imagine him well.
Ajamila: How do you manage that?
Kamali: What?
Ajamila: Well… imagining, what his eyes, what his hands will be like. What name we’ll give him.
Kamali: I just close my eyes and see all this…
Ajamila: Kamali, dear, let’s go home.
Kamali: Home, why? We are having such a good time walking.
Ajamila: I’m feeling unwell.
Kamali: Something feels wrong…
Ajamila: Is your head hurting?
Kamali: Prabhu, do you even hear me?
Ajamila: Huh? What? Ah… I hear you, I hear.
Ajamila: Yes, I hear you…
Kamali: Now everything will be fine. You will feel better soon.
Kamali: Just rest for a bit and you’ll feel better.

16.
Ajamila: Oh Lord, what’s happening to me?
Ajamila: This has never happened before.
Ajamila: Why can’t I get her out of my head?
Ajamila: I don’t want this! Where is my mind?
Ajamila: Where is my piety? What am I doing?
Ajamila: It’s not too late to stop!
Ajamila: My wife, my Kamali, I can’t treat her like this.
Varsha: You probably also want to be with me here in the forest, where no one sees us?
Varsha: Because you like me…
Varsha: …And if you want to find me, you will….
Varsha: …My love costs something….
Ajamila: Forgive me. I can’t. Her hands, voice… I can’t…

17.

Varsha: Well, you know, if you have money — come in, but if not…
Man: Not today, but I'll have it tomorrow… You know that.
Varsha: When you have it, then you can come…
Man: You can’t treat me like this, I won’t leave you today, I’ve left everything to come to you.
Varsha: Let me go! It hurts!
Man: "Let her go". Stop acting innocent!
Ajamila: Let her go!
Man: Who are you?
Varsha: Well, come in since you’ve come. I’ve been waiting!
Ajamila: Now I understand why you didn’t want to let me in!
Ajamila: You were waiting for this… Brahman…
Varsha: And what about you?
Man: Me? Oh, I will leave and never come back again.
Man: And you… very soon
Man: …will turn into…
Varsha: Well?
Man: Into an old woman who no one needs!
Man: Be happy, Brahman.
Man: We’ll meet again.

18.

Varsha: Well, hello, Brahman Ajamila.
Ajamila: Hello… uh…
Varsha: Varsha. That’s my name.
Ajamila: Hello, Varsha.
Varsha: I thought Brahmans sleep at this time.
Varsha: But look, Brahmans are fully awake and wandering.
Varsha: So…
Varsha: You’re not in a hurry?
Varsha: Well then, I am not in a hurry either. Let’s go…
Varsha: Ajamila…
Varsha: Well, come to me…
Guru: Ajamila!
Son: Yes, Gurudev…
Guru: Once long ago, I asked you… Are you ready to follow the principles of religion to the end of your life …What did you answer me then?
Son: That I am ready, Gurudev…

19.

Kamali: Ajamila…
Father: Ajamila, is that it?
Ajamila: What do you want?
Father: You were gone for almost a day, you come and just go to sleep? Did you want to tell me anything?
Father: No way, Ajamila. You will explain everything to me. Where have you been? Why did you make
me and your wife worry? And where is the money that was donated to us?
Ajamila: It was my money! I earned it! And now forget it! There’s no more money.
Father: How dare you raise your voice at me?
Ajamila: Leave me alone!
Father: Let’s go, daughter… Let it be…
Father: Where were you? And where is the money that was donated to us?
Ajamila: It was my money, I earned it,
Ajamila: forget about it, there’s no more money! Leave me alone!
Kamali: Father!

20.

Varsha: You left early in the morning, and now look — it’s noon. Only a little time has passed…
Ajamila: I wanted to sleep, but I couldn’t. They didn’t let me…
Varsha: Who didn’t let you?
Ajamila: Well, father and wife.
Varsha: Whose wife?
Ajamila: Mine.
Varsha: So you’re married?
Ajamila: Yes, but it’s nothing serious.
Varsha: Well, if it’s not serious for you, it’s even less so for me.
Varsha: So, you have a family… Good… And what did you tell them?
Ajamila: What could I tell them?
Varsha: Do you not care?
Ajamila: …not really. Though now it’s easier. Just three days ago, it was very hard for me. But then something changed.
Ajamila: Something inside me burned out. I no longer want to think and weigh every step. And to be afraid of what others will say. I’ve done that my whole life.
Ajamila: I want to breathe freely, to live without fear and remorse. After that meeting with you, there, in the forest…
Ajamila: I couldn’t think of anything else but you. Neither my family nor my duties, nothing could make me forget you. Your hands, your voice, your eyes.
Ajamila: I don’t want to play the role of a faithful husband and loving son, when here is a burning fire inside me.
Ajamila: I can’t, and I don’t want to. I just want to be with you, only with you.
Varsha: So what… have you fallen in love with me?
Ajamila: Yes…
Varsha: Have you really found something special in me?
Ajamila: Oh! You don’t even know how wonderful you are! You are my perfection. You are life itself to me! I just can’t live without you! I want to be only with you… only with you…

21.

Kamali: Where is he?
Lady: I just saw Ajamila… He went into the house of a well-known prostitute.
Father: I thought so.
Lady: Will you go get him?
Father: No. He couldn’t be kept by a young wife, nor by the path of religion he has followed for so long. If he has made his choice, what can I do? It’s all my fault. I invested everything I had in Ajamila. But he made his own choice.
Father: In an instant, the Lord rid me of my pride, my hopes, my expectations… My good name…
Father: All I can do now is pray that the Lord doesn’t leave him.

22.

Varsha: So what should we do?
Ajamila: What do you mean?
Varsha: You’ve been living with me for several days now… Your money has long run out. And you don’t have any new money. And all my… admirers… You chased them away…
Ajamila: If you’re worried about money, that’s not a problem for me.
Varsha: Really? That’s good news.
Ajamila: Yes. It was never a problem for me.
Varsha: And where will we live?
Ajamila: Live?.. We can live at my place. I will bring you to my house. You’ll have a separate room. If you agree to be with me — I’ll provide for you.
Varsha: Tell me, do Brahmans chant something every day? You have some mantras, don’t you?
Ajamila: Three times a day… A hymn to praise the Sun God…
Varsha: Three times a day! When was the last time you chanted them?
Ajamila: Well, probably last week. That was the last time.
Varsha: And then you found love?
Ajamila: Oh come on, I really do love you.
Varsha: Love… I believe… You don’t give up everything like that… And I don’t…
Ajamila: Okay, okay. I understand…
Varsha: Tell your family that I am… a maid. If they believe it, of course.
Varsha: Tell your wife…
Varsha: Although… Say whatever you want… But remember, I won’t work for you. You will be the one bringing money to me… For my love… Got it?
Varsha: We still have time left… How shall we spend it?
Ajamila: Come up to me, I’ll whisper it in your ear.
Ajamila: You know how much I adore you…

23.

Kamali: Ajamila… You came! You're back!
Varsha: Is this your wife?
Kamali: Prabhu… Who is this woman?
Ajamila: Kamali, meet Varsha.
Kamali: Why has she come to our house?
Ajamila: She will help you with the household.
Kamali: Prabhu, am I not managing by myself?

24.

Varsha: So what, am I going to live here?
Ajamil: Yes…
Varsha: And… She… Where will she live?
Ajamil: There…
Varsha: Ajamila, I need a bed here. I need shelves for my clothes and jewelry boxes. You will buy me jewelry, won’t you? I remember, you promised… And tell her not to hover over me. This is now my home too. And we will live here together.
Varsha: Wait… Where are you going?
Varsha: Now, every time she wants to cry, you’ll run to comfort her? Do you think that’s normal?
Ajamil: She is my wife!
Varsha: And so? I need attention too. You don’t want to get me upset, do you?
Ajamil: Okay.

25.

Ajamila: I want to spend tonight in the yard. I can no longer and do not want to stay in this house. Bring a bed out for me.

Father: Ajamila, come to your father.

Ajamila: What is it, father?

Father: My time has come, there is no one else for me to think about but the Lord. And I won’t stay here anymore. I will leave… I hope it will be easier for you.

Ajamila: Let’s go, daughter…
